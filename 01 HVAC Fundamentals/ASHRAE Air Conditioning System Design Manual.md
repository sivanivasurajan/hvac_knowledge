This second edition represents a major update and revision of
the ASHRAE Air-Conditioning System Design Manual. The
request that drove this revision effort was simply to make a success-
ful resource more current. The revision process involved a thorough
editing of all text in the manual, the addition of SI units throughout,
the updating of references, and the editing of many illustrations.
New material dealing with design process, indoor air quality, desic-
cant dehumidification, and “green” HVAC&R systems was added.
The editor acknowledges the active assistance of a Project
Monitoring Subcommittee (with Warren Hahn as Chairman) from
ASHRAE Technical Committee 9.1, which supervised the revision
of this manual. The editor and committees are grateful to several
individuals who reviewed all or parts of the draft of this revision
and made valuable suggestions for improvements and clarifications
(see list of contributors). Andrew Scheidt, University of Oregon,
provided graphic assistance for the editing of many illustrations.

1.1 PURPOSE OF THIS MANUAL
This manual was prepared to assist entry-level engineers in the
design of air-conditioning systems. It is also usable—in conjunc-
tion with fundamental HVAC&R resource materials—as a senior-
or graduate-level text for a university course in HVAC system
design. This manual was intended to fill the void between theory
and practice, to bridge the gap between real-world design practices
and the theoretical knowledge acquired in the typical college course
or textbook. Courses and texts usually concentrate on theoretical
calculations and analytical procedures or they focus upon the
design of components. This manual focuses upon applications.
The manual has two main parts: (1) a narrative description of
design procedures and criteria organized into ten chapters and (2) six
appendices with illustrative examples presented in greater detail.
The user/reader should be familiar with the general concepts of
HVAC&R equipment and possess or have access to the four-volume
ASHRAE Handbook series and appropriate ASHRAE special publi-
cations to obtain grounding in the fundamentals of HVAC&R sys-
tem design. Information contained in the Handbooks and in special
publications is referenced—but not generally repeated—herein. In
addition to specific references cited throughout the manual, a list of
general references (essentially a bibliography) is presented at the
end of this chapter.
The most difficult task in any design problem is how to begin.
The entry-level professional does not have experience from similar
projects to fall back on and is frequently at a loss as to where to
start a design. To assist the reader in this task, a step-by-step
sequence of design procedures is outlined for a number of systems.
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
2⏐ INTRODUCTION
Simple rules are given, where applicable, to assist the new designer
in making decisions regarding equipment types and size.
Chapter 2 addresses the difference between analysis and
design. The chapter covers the basic issues that are addressed dur-
ing the design phases of a building project and discusses a number
of factors that influence building design, such as codes and eco-
nomic considerations. Human comfort and indoor air quality, and
their implications for HVAC&R systems design, are discussed in
Chapter 3. Load calculations are reviewed in Chapter 4. The specif-
ics of load calculation methodologies are not presented since they
are thoroughly covered in numerous resources and are typically
conducted via computer programs. HVAC&R system components
and their influence on system design are discussed in Chapter 5.
Chapters 6 through 8 cover the design of all-air, air-and-water,
and all-water systems, respectively. Here, again, a conscious effort
was made not to duplicate material from the ASHRAE Handbook—
HVAC Systems and Equipment, except in the interest of continuity.
Chapter 6 is the largest and most detailed chapter. Its treatment of
the air side of air-conditioning systems is equally applicable to the
air side of air-and-water systems; thus, such information is not
repeated in Chapter 7. Chapter 9 covers a variety of special
HVAC&R systems. Controls are treated in Chapter 10.
The appendices contain detailed descriptions and design calcu-
lations for a number of actual HVAC&R-related building projects.
They serve to illustrate the procedures discussed in the main body
of the manual. The projects in the appendices were chosen to cover
a variety of building applications and HVAC system types. They
help to give the entering professional a “feel” for the size of
HVAC&R equipment, and they indicate how a designer tackles par-
ticular design problems. Since these examples come from actual
projects, they include values (such as thermal properties, utility
costs, owner preferences) that are particular to the specific contexts
from which they were drawn. The purpose of the examples is to
show process, not to suggest recommended or preferred outcomes.
A few words of advice: do not hesitate to make initial design
assumptions. No matter how far off the specific values of a final
solution they might prove to be, assumptions enable the designer to
start on a project and to gradually iterate and improve a proposed
design until a satisfactory solution has been obtained. Frequently,
more experienced colleagues may be able to assist by giving coun-
sel and the benefit of their experience, but do not hesitate to plunge
ahead on your own. Good luck!

1.2 HOW BEST TO USE THIS MANUAL
The following suggestions are made to obtain maximum bene-
fit from this manual:
1.
Consider the general category of the building being designed
and read the appropriate chapters in the ASHRAE Handbook—
HVAC Applications and the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Sys-
tems and Equipment to determine likely systems to consider
for application to the project.
2.
Familiarize yourself with the theory and basic functions of
common HVAC&R equipment. The best sources for this
information are HVAC&R textbooks and the ASHRAE Hand-
book series.
3.
Read the chapters in this manual that address the systems of
interest.
4.
Review the example problems in the appropriate appendices of
this manual.
5.
Become familiar with state and local building codes, ASHRAE
standards and guidelines, and applicable National Fire Protec-
tion Association (NFPA) resources.
Remember that this manual, in general, does not repeat infor-
mation contained in ASHRAE Handbooks and special publications.
You cannot, therefore, rely on this manual as the only reference for
design work. As you gain experience, make notes of important con-
cepts and ideas (what worked and what did not work) and keep
these notes in a readily accessible location. This manual is intended
to point the way toward building such a design database.
The best design reference available is the experience of your
colleagues and peers. While an attempt has been made in this man-
ual to incorporate the experience of design professionals, no static
written material can replace dynamic face-to-face interaction with
your colleagues. Use every opportunity to pick their brains, and let
them tell you what did not work. Often, more is learned from fail-
ures than from successes.
1.3 UNITS
The first edition of this manual was written using I-P (inch-
pound) units as the primary measurement system. In this edition SI
(System International) units are shown in brackets following the I-P
units. Conversions to SI units are “soft approximations” with, for
example, 4 in. being converted as 100 mm (versus the more accu-
4⏐ INTRODUCTION
rate conversion to 101.6 mm or use of a true SI commercial size
increment for a given product). See the ASHRAE guide “SI for
HVAC&R” (available at no cost from the ASHRAE Web site,
www.ashrae.org) for detailed information on preferred measure-
ment units and conversion factors for HVAC&R design work.

A number of equipment manufacturers have developed HVAC
design manuals and/or equipment application notes. These are not
specifically listed here, in accordance with ASHRAE’s commer-
cialism policy, but are recommended as sources of practical design
and application advice. A search of manufacturers’ Web sites (for
manuals or education) will usually show what is currently available
(for free or for a fee).
An extensive list of applicable codes and standards, including
contact addresses for promulgating organizations, is provided in a
concluding chapter in each of the ASHRAE Handbooks.

2.1 DESIGN PROCESS CONTEXT
There are numerous variations of the design process, perhaps
as many as there are designers. To try and place the following infor-
mation into a common context, the design process structure used in
ASHRAE
Guideline
0-2005,
The
Commissioning
Process
(ASHRAE 2005a) will be used. For purposes of building commis-
sioning, the acquisition of a building is assumed to flow through
several broad phases: predesign, design, construction, and occu-
pancy and operation. The design phase is often broken into concep-
tual design, schematic design, and design development subphases.
Although the majority of design hours will be spent in the design
development phase, each of these phases plays a critical role in a
successful building project. Each phase should have input from the
HVAC&R design team. The HVAC&R design team should strive to
provide input during the earliest phases (when HVAC&R design
input has historically been minimal) since these are the most critical
to project success, as they set the stage for all subsequent work.
Design should start with a clear statement of design intent. In
commissioning terms, the collective project intents form the
Owner’s Project Requirements (OPR) document. Intent is simply a
declaration of the owner’s (and design team’s) needs and wants in
terms of project outcomes. HVAC&R design intents might include
exceptional energy efficiency, acceptable indoor air quality, low
maintenance, high flexibility, and the like. Each design intent must
be paired with a design criterion, which provides a benchmark for
minimum acceptable performance relative to the intent. For exam-
ple, an intent to provide thermal comfort might be benchmarked via
a criterion that requires compliance with ANSI/ASHRAE Standard
55-2004, Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occu-
pancy (ASHRAE 2004b), and an intent for energy efficiency might
CHAPTER 2
THE DESIGN PROCESS
10⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
be benchmarked with a criterion that requires compliance with
ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1, Energy Standard for Build-
ings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings.
Design validation involves the use of a wide range of esti-
mates, calculations, simulations, and related techniques to confirm
that a chosen design option will in fact meet the appropriate design
criteria. Design validation is essential to successful design; other-
wise there is no connection between design intent and design deci-
sions. Pre- and post-occupancy validations are also important to
ensure that the construction process and ensuing operational proce-
dures have delivered design intent. Such validations are a key
aspect of building commissioning.
2.2 DESIGN VERSUS ANALYSIS
Anyone who has taken a course in mathematics or any of the
physical sciences is familiar with the process of analysis. In a typi-
cal analysis, a set of parameters is given that completely describes a
problem, and the solution (even if difficult to obtain) is unique.
There is only one correct solution to the problem; all other answers
are wrong.
Design problems are inherently different—much different. A
design problem may or may not be completely defined (some of the
parameters may be missing) and there are any number of potentially
acceptable answers. Some solutions may be better than others, but
there is no such thing as a single right answer to a design problem.
There are degrees of quality to design problem solutions. Some
solutions may be better (often in a qualitative or conceptual sense)
than others from a particular viewpoint. For a different context or
client, other solutions may be better. It is important to clearly
understand the difference between analysis and design. If you are
used to looking for the correct answer to a problem (via analysis),
and are suddenly faced with problems that have several acceptable
answers (via design), how do you decide which solution to select?
Learn to use your judgment (or the advice of experienced col-
leagues) to weigh the merits of a number of solutions that seem to
work for a particular design problem in order to select the best
among them.
Figures 2-1 and 2-2 illustrate the analysis and design pro-
cesses, respectively. Analysis proceeds in a generally unidirectional
flow from given data to final answer with the aid of certain analyti-
cal tools. Design, however, is an iterative process. Although there
are certain “givens” to start with, they are often not immutable but
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐11
subject to modification during the design process. For example, an
owner or architect may be confronted with the energy implications
of excessively large expanses of glass that had been originally spec-
ified and may decide to reduce the area of glazing or change the
glazing properties. The mechanical designer may try various sys-
tem components and control strategies before finding one that best
suits the particular context and conditions. Thus, design consists of
a continuous back-and-forth process as the designer selects from a
universe of available systems, components, and control options to
synthesize an optimum solution within the given constraints. This
iterative design procedure incorporates analysis. Analysis is an
important part of any design.
Since the first step in design is to map out the general bound-
aries within which solutions are to be found, it may be hard to know
where and how to start because there is no background from which
to make initial assumptions. To overcome this obstacle, make
informed initial assumptions and improve on them through subse-
quent analysis. To assist you in making such initial assumptions,
simple rules are given throughout the chapters in this manual, and
illustrative examples are provided in the appendices.
2.3 DESIGN PHASES
A new engineer must understand how buildings are designed.
Construction documents (working drawings and specifications)
Figure 2-1. Diagram illustrating analysis.
12⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
for a building are developed as a team effort. The architect usually
acts as the prime design professional and project coordinator,
although experienced owners and developers may deal directly
with pre-selected HVAC&R consultants. The architect interfaces
with the owner, directs the architectural staff, and coordinates the
work of outside or in-house mechanical, electrical, and structural
engineers (among other consultants). The negotiated design fees
for the consultants’ work establish an economically viable level of
effort. This fiscal constraint usually seriously limits the amount of
time that can be allocated to studies of alternative systems or
innovative approaches.
The project phases outlined below are those adopted by
ASHRAE Guideline 0-2005 and are those generally recognized by
the architecture profession. More explicit phases may be defined for
certain projects or under certain contracts.
Figure 2-2. Diagram illustrating design.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐13
2.3.1 Predesign Phase
Before a mechanical engineer can design an HVAC system, a
building program must be created. This is usually prepared by the
client or his/her consultants. The program establishes space needs
and develops a project budget. The building program should
include, but need not be limited to, the following:
•
The client’s objectives and strategies for the initial and
future functional use of the building, whether it be a single-
or multiple-family dwelling or a commercial, industrial, ath-
letic, or other facility.
•
A clear description of function(s) for each discrete area within
the building.
•
The number, distribution, and usage patterns of permanent
occupants and visitors.
•
The type, distribution, and usage patterns of owner-provided
heat-producing equipment.
•
The geographic site location, access means, and applicable
building and zoning codes.
•
The proposed building area, height, number of stories, and
mechanized circulation requirements.
•
The owner’s capital cost and operating cost budgets.
•
A clear statement of anticipated project schedule and/or time
constraints.
•
A clear statement of required or expected project quality.
Although some of this information may not be available before
the mechanical designer starts to work, it must be obtained as soon
as possible to ensure that only those HVAC&R systems that are
compatible with the building program are considered.
While the architect prepares the general building program, the
mechanical engineer has the responsibility of developing a disci-
pline-specific program even though some of this information may
be provided by the architect or owner. The building program and
use profile provided by the owner or architect and the HVAC&R
systems program developed by the engineer in response to the
building functional program should be explicitly documented for
future reference. This documentation is termed the Owner’s Project
Requirements (OPR) by ASHRAE Guideline 0-2005, and it pro-
vides the context for all design decisions. All changes made to the
program during the design process should be recorded so that the
documentation is always up-to-date.
14⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
The information that should be contained in the HVAC&R sys-
tem program includes
•
design outdoor dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures (absolute
and coincident);
•
heating and cooling degree-days/hours;
•
design wind velocity (and direction) for winter and summer;
•
applicable zoning, building, mechanical, fire, and energy
codes; and
•
rate structure, capacity, and characteristics of available utilities
and fuels.
Additional information regarding solar radiation availability
and subsurface conditions would be included if use of a solar ther-
mal system or ground-source heat pump was anticipated.
The environmental conditions to be maintained for each build-
ing space should be defined by
•
dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures during daytime occupied
hours, nighttime occupied hours, and unoccupied hours;
•
ventilation and indoor air quality requirements;
•
any special conditions, such as heavy internal equipment loads,
unusual lighting requirements, noise- and-vibration-free areas,
humidity limits, and redundancy for life safety and security; and
•
acceptable range of conditions for each of the above.
An understanding of the functional use for each area is essen-
tial to select appropriate HVAC&R systems and suitable control
approaches because the capabilities of proposed systems must be
evaluated and compared to the indoor environmental requirements.
For example, if some rooms in a building require humidity control
while others do not, the HVAC system must be able to provide
humidification to areas requiring it without detriment to the build-
ing enclosure or other spaces. Some areas may require cooling,
while others need only ventilation or heating. This will affect selec-
tion of an appropriate system.
2.3.2 Design Phase
In conventional (business-as-usual) building projects, serious
work on HVAC&R system design typically occurs in the later
stages of the design phase. Projects where energy efficiency and/or
green building design are part of the intent or building types where
HVAC&R systems are absolutely integral to building design (labo-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐15
ratories, hospitals, etc.), will see HVAC&R design begin earlier and
play a more integrated role in design decision making.
The design phase is often broken down into three subphases:
conceptual design, schematic design, and design development. The
terms schematic design, design development, and construction
documents are also commonly used to describe design process sub-
phases. The purpose of conceptual/schematic design efforts is to
develop an outline solution to the OPR that captures the owner’s
attention, gets his/her buy-in for further design efforts, and meets
budget. Schematic (or early design development) design efforts
should serve as proof of concept for the earliest design ideas as
elements of the solution are further developed and locked into
place. During later design development/construction documents,
the final drawings and specifications are prepared as all design
decisions are finalized and a complete analysis of system perfor-
mance is undertaken.
The schematic/early design development stage should involve
the preliminary selection and comparison of appropriate HVAC&R
systems. All proposed systems must be able to maintain the envi-
ronmental conditions for each space as defined in the OPR. The
ability to provide adequate thermal zoning is a critical aspect of
such capability. For each system considered during this phase, eval-
uate the relative space (and volume) requirements for equipment,
ducts, and piping; fuel and/or electrical use and thermal storage
requirements; initial and life-cycle costs; acoustical requirements
and capabilities; compatibility with the building plan and the struc-
tural system; and the effects on indoor air quality, illumination, and
aesthetics. Also consider energy code compliance and green design
implications (as appropriate).
Early in the design phase, the HVAC&R designer may be asked
to provide an evaluation of the impact of building envelope design
options (vis-à-vis energy code compliance and trade-offs and/or
green building intents), heavy lighting loads (i.e., more than 2 W/ft2
[22 W/m2]), and other unusual internal loads (i.e., more than 4 W/ft2
[43 W/m2]) on HVAC system performance and requirements. Ques-
tions should also be expected regarding the optimum location of
major mechanical equipment—considering spatial efficiency, sys-
tem effectiveness, aesthetics, and acoustical criteria. Depending
upon the level of information available, the designer may be asked to
prepare preliminary HVAC system sizing or performance estimates
based upon patterns developed through experience or based upon
results from similar, previously designed projects. Some design esti-
16⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
mates that may be useful for a first cut are given in Table 2-1. Addi-
tional values appropriate for this design phase can be found in the
ASHRAE Pocket Guide for Air Conditioning, Heating, Ventilation,
Refrigeration (ASHRAE 2005c).
If envelope and internal loads are reasonably well defined,
peak load and rough energy calculations for alternative HVAC sys-
tems may be prepared at this time using appropriate methods for
presentation to the architect and/or owner. Although they are pre-
liminary and will change as the building design proceeds, such pre-
liminary loads are usually definitive enough to compare the
performance of alternative systems because these systems will be
sized to meet the same loads. As you gain experience, you will be
able to estimate the likely magnitude of the loads for each area in a
building with a little calculation effort.
Resources useful during this phase of design include design
manuals, textbooks, equipment literature, and data from existing
installations. Frequently, this type of early system evaluation
eliminates all but a few systems that are capable of providing the
environmental requirements and are compatible with the build-
ing structure.
If the client requests it, if architectural details have been suffi-
ciently developed, and if the mechanical engineer’s fee has been set
at a level to warrant it, comparisons between construction (first)
costs and operating (life-cycle) costs and the performance of differ-
ent HVAC&R systems can be made in greater detail. Typically, one
system is set as a reference (or base) and other proposed systems
are compared to this base system. Such an analysis would proceed

utility tariffs, energy charges, demand charges, and off-peak
rates, as appropriate.
3.
Calculate the number of operating hours and hourly operating
costs for each subsystem of each candidate HVAC system. This
can be done manually or by computer using a simplified energy
analysis method or proprietary programs offered by equipment
manufacturers and software developers.
4.
Using the local utility tariffs, calculate monthly utility costs
and sum them for the year.
5.
If required by the owner or design team, perform comparative
life-cycle (or other) cost analyses, as described in Section 2.8.
It is important to note that the seasonal or annual in-use effi-
ciency of equipment is not the same as the equipment’s full-load
efficiency. Consider efficiency at part-load conditions (the number
of hours at 100%, 90%, 80%, 60% of full load, etc.) when calculat-
ing building energy requirements. As an annual average, cooling
equipment operates at 50% to 85% of capacity; fans and pumps
operate at 60% to 100% of capacity.
In order to determine actual equipment operating profiles, data
on hourly weather variations throughout the year are required. The
hours of dry-bulb temperature occurrences in 5°F [2.8°C] incre-
ments (or bins) and coincident monthly average wet-bulb tempera-
tures at many locations can be obtained from the Air Force Weather
Data Manual (USAF 1988). Bin and degree-hour weather data are
also available from ASHRAE (1995a) and the National Oceanic &
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA; www.noaa.gov/).
Operating costs are very much a function of the way a building
is operated—how much is the indoor temperature allowed to drop
and for how many unoccupied hours in the winter? Will the cooling
system be shut down at night and on weekends? Do special areas,
such as computer or process rooms, require cooling 24 hours year-
round? If such information is not available, educated assumptions
must be used. All systems must be analyzed under the same operat-
ing conditions for comparisons to be valid.
At the conclusion of the schematic design phase, a recommen-
dation regarding HVAC&R system selection is made to the owner/
architect. That recommendation is usually approved if the engi-
neer's reasoning is sound and reflects the client’s objectives. Should
the owner select another approach—possibly because of weighting
factors different from those used by the design team (often, unfortu-
nately, low first cost over life-cycle performance)—that is the
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐19
owner's prerogative. Design decisions should be clearly docu-
mented whether they constitute approval of, or deviation from, the
designer's proposals.
The schematic HVAC design is used to coordinate critical
HVAC&R system requirements with the architectural, structural,
electrical, and fire protection systems, which are also in the sche-
matic design stage, to resolve potential conflicts. Close integration
of the mechanical and electrical systems with structure, plan, and
building configuration requires the cooperation of all team mem-
bers—architect, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, structural
engineer, acoustical consultant, and professionals from other disci-
plines. Such coordination and cooperation will extend to the other
design phases.
The requirements of state or local building or energy codes (see
Section 2.7) must also be considered at this point because of restric-
tions on the amount of glass, other envelope assembly require-
ments, lighting, HVAC&R system and equipment limitations, and,
in some instances, on the annual building energy budget. If
required, energy budgets are established. Some states or jurisdic-
tions require a simplified prescriptive compliance calculation that
can be prepared by hand; when annual energy-budget compliance
calculations are required, however, these must be prepared by com-
puter simulation. It is wise to select a computer program that will
minimize the inputs required for both the load and the energy anal-
yses—while providing acceptable accuracy. Programs are available
that share input between loads and energy programs.
Architectural floor plans and elevations are developed in
greater detail; structural, mechanical, and electrical systems are
designed in compliance with applicable building codes; and draw-
ings in preliminary form are prepared. Heat loss, heat gain, and
ventilation calculations are refined and used to design the air and
water distribution systems and to select equipment. System sizes
and capacities are selected to match design and part-load condi-
tions. The designer has the choice of sizing pipes and ducts manu-
ally or using a variety of computer programs. The main objective,
however, is to develop system layouts for space requirements and
cost estimates. If required by code or owner intent, more detailed
energy studies are undertaken at this time and the accompanying
calculations are performed. Construction details and cost estimates
are refined based upon additional information. After preliminary
drawings, outline specifications, and cost estimates have been
approved by the owner, the project scope and solution are essen-
20⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
tially tied down, and only minor changes are generally desirable in
the final stage of the design work.
In the late design development/construction document stage,
specific equipment (model numbers and sizes) is selected. Duct and
piping systems are designed and control strategies are finalized.
Final compliance with owner requirements is verified. The budget
is refined, and some of the earlier contingency costs can be elimi-
nated. It is possible that trade-offs may occur at this stage based
upon performance and costs. For example, a more efficient chiller
or sophisticated control system may be selected if it can be shown
that these changes reduce the cost of the mechanical systems
accordingly or provide a more energy-efficient or “greener” build-
ing—with any higher first costs justified by lower life-cycle costs or
improved building performance.
The documents submitted to the owner at the end of this stage
of design include complete architectural, mechanical, electrical,
and structural drawings; specifications; and estimates of construc-
tion cost. After approval by the owner, the documents (including
energy code calculations, if required) are submitted to government
agencies for code review and to contractors to obtain firm bids, with
the contract awarded to the lowest responsible bidder or to one who
may be able to best meet other owner requirements, such as sched-
ule, quality control, or project experience.
At this time, or at the end of construction, the owner may ask
for additional computer simulations to provide guidance for opti-
mization of systems operations. Such analyses should be per-
formed using the most comprehensive energy simulation
available because the results will influence an owner’s economic
decision making. Studies of this type require extensive and
detailed inputs and are costly. Extra services of this type (and/or
last-minute owner-required changes) constitute additional work
for the HVAC&R design engineer, who should be reimbursed for
such efforts.
2.3.3 Construction Phase
During construction, HVAC&R engineers generally:
•
Check shop drawings to verify that equipment, piping, and
other items submitted by manufacturers and contractors have
been selected and will be installed to conform to the project
plans and specifications.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐21
•
Make periodic visits to the building under construction to
observe and maintain a log of the work being installed by the
contractors.
•
Provide interpretation of the construction documents when
questions arise at the project site.
•
Witness tests for system performance, such as airflow volume
and temperature, equipment efficiency, control sequence strate-
gies, and indoor air quality, if called for in the professional
agreement and provided for in the fee. These activities may or
may not be part of a formal commissioning process (see
below).
•
Ascertain proper workmanship and extent of completion to
ensure that contractor invoices for work completed during each
billing period are correct.
2.3.4 Commissioning
Recently, the process of building commissioning has received
increased attention because of the ever-increasing complexity of
modern building systems. While a simple building can be built by
the contractor and turned over to the owner with only minimum
instructions, this is no longer possible for large buildings and their
complex systems and numerous subsystems. Just as the US Navy
will not accept a ship without a sea trial, so a savvy building owner
will no longer accept a large building on completion without a
series of tests that demonstrate the performance of the building sys-
tems, preferably over a full season of weather conditions. New
types of engineers and technicians—building commissioning spe-
cialists—have evolved. It is their task to verify the proper function-
ing of all building systems and subsystems. This often constitutes
the owner’s acceptance process.
Frequently, the design engineer will need to be present when
the HVAC&R systems are being tested, particularly when a system
does not perform in accordance with design specifications. The
designer is the person best qualified to troubleshoot such a situation
and to determine where the fault lies. Complete design documenta-
tion should be on hand when that situation arises. Consult
ASHRAE Guideline 0-2005 for additional information.
2.3.5 Post-Occupancy Services
Ideally, an engineer should be retained for post-occupancy ser-
vices to check energy use, operating costs, user reactions, system
performance, and (with other team members) “total building perfor-
22⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
mance.” Unfortunately, this evaluation is not usually done, although
it is gaining increasing acceptance. In some cases, the commission-
ing engineer will support building operations, familiarize operating
personnel with the system, and assist them in operating it for a
period of one year after building completion. This may include
adjustments and modifications to the HVAC&R systems (usually
involving control subsystems). Whether these tasks are performed
as part of the design package or under a separately negotiated con-
tract depends upon the individual project circumstances.
The building owner/operator should be encouraged to realize
that modern large buildings are complex systems requiring skilled
personnel to operate them. Unless skilled operators are hired to
start, newly hired operators must be trained to understand and oper-
ate the HVAC&R systems, and the person best qualified to train
them is the one who designed the system. Videotapes and other
training aids can be used to assist the engineer in this task.
2.4 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HVAC&R
AND OTHER BUILDING SYSTEMS
HVAC&R systems cannot be designed in a vacuum. Other
building systems, singly and in combination, profoundly affect the
functional performance, physical size, capacity, appearance, operat-
ing efficiency, maintenance, and operating and initial costs of an
HVAC&R system. Thus, they are essential elements in the HVAC
design process. Conversely, the HVAC&R system has an impact on
all other building systems. This must be taken into account by the
HVAC&R system designer during the design process.
2.4.1 Building Envelope
2.4.1.1 How the Building Envelope Affects an HVAC&R
System. The thermal characteristics of the envelope—opaque walls
and roof, fenestration, and even the floor—affect the magnitude and
duration of the building heat loss and cooling load. Orientation,
envelope construction, and shading greatly influence solar loads.
Cooling load and heat loss directly influence the required capacity
of the primary energy conversion devices (boilers and chillers) and
the size, complexity, and cost of the distribution systems (ducts,
fans, pipes, pumps). The need for perimeter heating is a function of
climate, opaque wall thermal characteristics, window area and type,
and tightness of the envelope relative to infiltration. High-perfor-
mance envelopes may reduce or eliminate the need for perimeter
heating in many climates.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐23
A heavy envelope of brick or masonry provides thermal mass;
such mass, by shifting loads, affects the operating cycle of the heat-
ing and cooling equipment. The greater the internal building mass,
the less extensive are the indoor temperature excursions. The place-
ment of thermal insulation, whether on the exterior or the interior
side of the envelope, affects heating and cooling load patterns. The
envelope construction and the location of the vapor retarder (if
required) also determine the transfer of moisture between the build-
ing spaces and the outdoors, thus affecting humidification and
dehumidification requirements. The interaction of HVAC system
and envelope relative to moisture flows is especially critical to
building success in hot-humid and cold climates.
A building can be configured to provide solar shading and
wind protection, which will influence heating and cooling loads and
control strategies. By reducing transmission and radiation transfer
at the perimeter, the envelope reduces the influence of climate on
the building interior and thereby affects the designation of thermal
zones. If loads in a building do not vary much with time of day,
solar intensity, and wind velocity and direction, an HVAC system
can be less complex and less costly.
Another effect of the envelope on HVAC&R design is the use
of daylighting to offset electric lighting. Less heat is gained with
well-designed daylighting than with electric lighting for the same
illumination levels, so cooling requirements are reduced.
2.4.1.2 How the HVAC&R System Affects a Building
Envelope. The HVAC&R system can affect the appearance of the
building envelope. Outdoor air intake louvers in walls, window air
conditioners, and through-the-wall units obviously affect the
appearance of a building. This may limit system selection options
where the resulting appearance is not acceptable to the architect
or client.
Cooling towers, usually located on the roof, affect the physical
appearance of a building. Other rooftop equipment, such as pack-
aged air conditioners, air-cooled condensers, and air intake and
exhaust hoods/fans, may have a similar effect. Coordination of
intake/exhaust locations and louvers will be required for ventilation
heat recovery systems. Attractive architectural enclosures can
reduce the aesthetic disadvantage of much rooftop equipment.
Under certain conditions, such equipment can be placed at ground
level and camouflaged by landscaping. Locating condenser/com-
pressor units for buildings with multiple split systems can be espe-
24⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
cially challenging. The discharge from cooling towers can be
corrosive, may leave drift residue on automobiles parked nearby,
and may carry bacteria, so cooling tower location is of prime
importance. Cooling towers located below condensers are subject to
overflow unless precautions are taken, while towers located above
condensers may experience pumping problems upon start-up.
The noise of outdoor HVAC&R equipment can be muffled by
well-designed acoustical screening, or equipment of higher quality
or slower speed can be selected for quieter operation. Some locali-
ties prohibit the installation of noisy, unmuffled equipment. Noise
from emergency generators should be considered; although not
likely to cause complaints when used during an emergency, such
equipment must be regularly run and tested. Site requirements for
ground-source heat pumps must also be considered when looking at
exterior design issues. Alternative energy approaches may require
coordination of space and location for elements such as solar col-
lectors, hot water storage, or ice/chilled water storage.
2.4.2 HVAC&R Systems and Structure
All HVAC&R equipment requires structural support. The
HVAC&R designer must inform the structural engineer of the loca-
tion of major items of mechanical equipment early in the design
phase. Heavy equipment, such as boilers, tanks, chillers, compres-
sors, and large air handlers, should preferably be located on the
lowest building level, on a concrete sub-base, and with vibration
isolating bases for rotating equipment. This causes the least amount
of vibration to be transmitted into the building structure and consti-
tutes the simplest method of structural support for this equipment.
In earthquake-prone areas, physical restraint of HVAC&R equip-
ment may be required. In high-rise buildings, it is usually necessary
to install HVAC equipment on intermediate floors as well as on the
roof and/or basement.
Rooftop and intermediate-floor locations for HVAC&R equip-
ment require special structural supports as well as acoustical and
vibration control measures. In some cases, this may suggest against
locating equipment at these locations. When buildings are con-
structed with crawlspaces, without basements, or with lightweight
flooring, heavy machinery should be placed next to the building, if
possible, instead of within the building envelope, provided suffi-
cient and appropriate ground area is available.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐25
2.4.3 HVAC&R and Lighting and Other Electrical Loads
The heat generated by lighting is an important internal sensible
load to be considered during the design of an HVAC system. Since
these heat gains are a major air-conditioning load, closely coordi-
nate with the lighting designer to be immediately informed of any
changes to the lighting system design.
The amount of heat from lights contributing to the air-condi-
tioning load (or reducing space-heating requirements) depends
upon the type of lamp as well as other factors, such as the amount
of thermal mass near the light fixtures, air distribution patterns, sup-
ply air volume, type of luminaire, and whether ceilings are exposed
or suspended (forming an air plenum).
Internal heat gains from electric or gas-fired appliances,
motors, food service, and special equipment are normally sensible
(except for food or steam, which contribute latent heat). Supply air
volume is a function of sensible heat loads only, affecting the size
of fans, coils, ducts, and other equipment. When supply air or
return air troffers are used, the lighting system actually becomes
part of the HVAC system, and air supply temperatures to the room
(as well as supply air and return air distribution) are governed by
luminaire location.
Design rules for lighting loads are given in the “Air-Condition-
ing Cooling Load” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamen-
tals. For examples of lighting load calculations, see Appendices B
and C of this manual.
HVAC&R systems exert a substantial influence on the design
of building electrical systems. As a result, communication
between the mechanical and electrical engineers on a project must
be bidirectional. Larger HVAC&R equipment is typically a major
component of overall building electrical load. Selection of appro-
priate distribution voltages will likely be impacted by HVAC&R
equipment requirements. Electrical system peak demand control,
power factor adjustment, and power quality control are all sub-
stantially affected by HVAC&R equipment selections.
2.4.4 Fire and Smoke Control Systems
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards 90A,
90B, 92A, and 101 (NFPA 2002a, 2002b, 2000, 2003) are nation-
ally recognized model code documents that govern fire protection
and smoke control requirements. State and local fire codes incorpo-
rate and often modify these NFPA codes. Where such modifications
26⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
exist, their requirements supersede the NFPA documents. An
HVAC system can be used to provide fire-event air supply and
exhaust requirements in lieu of dedicated fire systems. When doing
so, emergency air distribution patterns are likely to vary from day-
to-day climate control requirements. In large buildings, fire zones
are separated by fire walls and doors. Therefore, the air distribution/
exhaust systems must meet the fire zoning pattern. Smoke zones
(not necessarily coincident with fire zones) may also be an issue in
some buildings. In stairwells, corridors, lobbies, or other areas
where positive pressure during emergencies may be required, the
HVAC system may be used to bring in outdoor air to pressurize the
space. Smoke exhaust and pressurization systems generally require
more airflow than is required for comfort conditioning. If the cli-
mate control system is to function as a smoke control system, it
must be capable of changing airflow volume and maintaining pres-
sure relationships when used in the fire protection mode. Use of a
dedicated smoke control system simplifies comfort system design.
Consult Principles of Smoke Management (Klote and Milke 2002)
for detailed information.
Other fire coordination issues address specific situations. For
example, standpipes and sprinkler systems located in unheated spaces
may require freeze protection. An emergency power system will be
required to operate smoke control systems during an emergency.
2.5 HVAC SYSTEM SELECTION ISSUES
2.5.1 Equipment Location and Space Requirements
From the mechanical engineer's point of view, equipment loca-
tion is governed by
•
space for equipment components, with adequate room for ser-
vicing, removal, and reinstallation;
•
pathways for heat transfer fluids (including distance, complex-
ity, and flexibility) from prime movers (chillers, boilers, fur-
naces) and air-handling equipment to points of use and
terminal locations;
•
access to the outdoors for air intakes and air exhaust/relief,
combustion air, and exhausting products of combustion;
•
headroom and support for ducts and pipes; and
•
acoustical considerations (noisy equipment should not be
located near occupied areas, especially acoustically sensitive
areas); appropriate location is the cheapest solution to mechan-
ical noise problems.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐27
Whenever possible, equipment requiring heavy electric ser-
vice, water, oil, or gas supply should be located near the point of
entry into the building of that utility service. Air-handling units and
decentralized air-conditioning systems require intake and exhaust/
relief air duct connections; outdoor air source locations may dictate
the placement of equipment. Exhaust louvers should be sufficiently
remote from intake louvers to prevent recirculation of exhaust air
into a building. This complicates design for heat recovery, unless
“runaround” aqueous, glycol, or refrigerant loops are used (see the
“Applied Heat Pump and Heat Recovery Systems” chapter in the
ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Systems and Equipment). Laboratory
and kitchen exhaust hood systems require makeup air and
code-specified fire protection (see the “Fire and Smoke Control”
chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications).
In large buildings, and in general for central systems, try to
locate air-handling units relatively close to the areas they serve in
order to reduce distribution duct runs and ductwork and insulation
costs. This will also save money via reduced duct friction losses and
fan pressure. Piping from boilers and chillers to air-handling units
is generally less costly than ductwork from air-handling units to ter-
minal outlets and requires less building space or headroom.
Space for horizontal duct and pipe distribution must be accom-
modated above the ceiling, under or through structural members, or
within a raised floor. Vertical shafts for ducts, pipes, and some con-
trol elements are usually accommodated within the building core or
defined satellite locations established by the architect. Raised floors
can carry power, communications, and data cabling and can also be
part of the HVAC distribution system.
A raised floor plenum, about 18 in. (460 mm) high, can be
employed as an air supply channel in an underfloor air distribution
system. A ceiling-based return air system is used in conjunction with
the underfloor supply and specially designed floor outlets. Air sup-
plied at floor level need not be as cold as air delivered by a ceiling or
high-wall supply, since the supply air envelopes and cools occupants
before it has picked up other space heat. This approach can shift the
balance of room versus coil loads in a system. See Bauman and Daly
(2003) for further information on underfloor air distribution.
Table 2-2 provides preliminary values for estimating the space
requirements for HVAC&R equipment.

AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐29
2.5.2 Access for Maintenance and Repair
Lack of adequate access to equipment is a major contributor to
poor system performance, ranging from unsatisfactory comfort
control to poor air quality to equipment breakdown. The following
is a general guide for designing for maintenance and repair:
•
Insist on allocation of adequate building space for HVAC&R
equipment.
•
Building dimensions are often not as “precise” as equipment
dimensions; therefore, always add a few inches for safety when
specifying clearances.
•
Provide clear space around fans, pumps, chillers, and other
equipment for service access and component removal, in
accordance with manufacturers’ recommendations.
•
Provide a clear passageway for the removal and replacement of
equipment.
•
Include access doors and service space between components of
air-handling equipment and for intake louvers and screens.
•
Specify adjustable slide-rail bases for motors to permit belt
drive replacement and alteration of the desired driven speed
and belt tension.
•
Require control components, such as actuators, sensing bulbs,
and instruments, to be accessible and protected from damage.
•
Mount pressure gauges and thermometers on vibration-free
supports.
•
Understand (during design) the owner’s preferred maintenance
procedure for terminal equipment—repair in place or replace
and then do shop repair?
•
Avoid locating HVAC equipment with dehumidification coils
above ceilings, especially above occupied spaces. If this cannot
be done, place large water-collecting pans beneath the equip-
ment to intercept the inevitable condensate drain pan overflow
and leakage.
•
Provide access by catwalks or interstitial decks for any equip-
ment located above high ceilings (e.g., in an auditorium).
•
Specify condensate pans and drains to be corrosion and leak
resistant, properly pitched, and cleanable.
•
Provide access for the measurement of airflow and water flow,
temperature, and pressure in major ductwork and piping.
•
Provide access for inspection and cleaning of major ductwork,
especially lined ducts and return air ducts.
30⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
•
Ensure that there is ready access for routine maintenance tasks,
such as changing air filters.
•
Specify accessible service shutoff drain and vent valves for all
water coils and risers.
•
Incorporate appropriate chemical treatment equipment for
open- and closed-loop water systems.
2.5.3 Noise and Vibration Control
Noise and vibration from HVAC&R equipment can be reduced
by proper selection of equipment, vibration control, and the interpo-
sition of sound attenuators and barriers. Residual sound may still be
objectionable, however, when equipment is located near occupied
areas. HVAC&R and architectural design decisions must go hand-in-
hand since acoustical control may involve equipment location, floor
and wall assemblies, and room function. HVAC&R equipment loca-
tions may influence spatial planning—so that areas requiring a low-
noise environment are not located next to major or noisy equipment.
The HVAC engineer should alert other members of the building
design team regarding the location of noisy equipment. On large,
acoustically sensitive buildings (e.g., theaters, museums), an acous-
tical consultant should be part of the design team.
Noise and vibration transmission to an occupied space by sys-
tem components will be an important consideration in system selec-
tion and design. Even after a system has been selected, component
selection will significantly affect system acoustical performance.
Noise can be transmitted to occupied spaces from central station
equipment along several airborne paths, through air or water flows,
along the walls of ducts or pipes, or through the building structure.
If central station pumps or fans are used, each of these paths must
be analyzed and the transmission of sound and vibration reduced to
an acceptable level. Supply air outlets (and other terminal devices)
must be selected to provide appropriate acoustical performance.
An initial step in noise control is to establish noise criteria for
all spaces. These criteria should be communicated to the client
early in the design process. All noise-generating sources within the
air-conditioning system must be identified. Then, the effects of
those sources can be controlled by
•
equipment selection,
•
air and water distribution system design,
•
structural/architectural containment,
•
dissipative absorption along the sound path, and
•
isolation from the occupied space, where feasible.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐31
These control techniques and information on how to apply
them provided in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals and the
ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications can usually lead to a
design procedure that can achieve the desired acoustical design
intent and criteria. The acoustical design of systems and the build-
ings they serve is, however, frequently quite complex and is often
the proper province of specialists known as acousticians. This is
especially true for spaces with exacting requirements, such as audi-
toriums, or where noise-generating components must be located
adjacent to occupied areas. Fan and other equipment noise emanat-
ing from cooling towers and air exhaust or intake points may affect
the ambient noise level of the neighborhood surrounding a building
and require evaluation and/or mitigation. Many municipalities have
codes governing equipment noise.
The major paths that govern the sound transmission character-
istics of an all-air distribution system are shown in Figure 2-3. It is
absolutely critical to distinguish between airborne sound transmis-
sion (where barriers are easily applied), duct-borne transmission
(where other mitigation techniques must be used), and noise gener-
ated by terminal devices. Occupied spaces on the floors directly
above or below a room housing an air-handling unit may also be
affected by equipment noise and vibration. Most acoustical barriers,
Figure 2-3. Noise propagation paths from HVAC equipment.
32⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
such as floors and ceilings, while in themselves potentially effec-
tive, frequently “leak” due to penetrations for pipes, electrical con-
duits, and similar items. Structural components do not constitute
effective sound barriers unless all penetrations are carefully sealed.
Air distribution systems, particularly high-pressure (high
velocity) systems, must be examined during all stages of design and
installation to ensure that they are quiet systems. The principal
sources of noise in an air system are the fans, the duct distribution
system itself, and terminal devices. Most fan manufacturers can
readily provide a sound power spectrum for a particular fan operat-
ing under a specific set of conditions. With this information, the
designer can select an acoustical treatment to reduce this sound
energy to an acceptable level. The fan noises most difficult to
remove are those in the lower octave bands. Thus, sound attenua-
tion in those bands is an important objective for acoustical treat-
ment of fans with low-frequency characteristics (such as centrifugal
fans). Sounds in the higher octave bands will normally be absorbed
in the duct distribution system, particularly if the ducts are lined.
For quiet operation, fans should be selected for maximum static (or
total) efficiency. In variable-air-volume systems, sound pressure
levels should also be checked at minimum system flow condition if
dampers, inlet vanes, or blade pitch fan control schemes are used.
In general, large fans at high static pressure conditions produce the
highest noise levels.
Noise and vibration can also be generated within and when exit-
ing the distribution system by the movement of air or water. These
problems can be controlled by velocity limitations, appropriate dis-
tribution layout, use of attenuators, and equipment selection. (For
piping design, see Section 5.7; for duct design, see Section 5.8.)
Several noise sources can exist within an air distribution system. In
general, components with higher pressure drops will produce higher
sound levels. Some of the sound-generating elements in ducts
include abrupt transitions, turbulent conditions caused by poor duct
fittings or improper duct taps, partially closed dampers used for bal-
ancing purposes, improperly located dampers in duct shafts, sound
traps improperly selected (with more than 2000 fpm [10 m/s] face
velocity), or installed too close to fans or fittings, sharp bends,
crimping of flexible connections, and duct leakage. A pres-
sure-reducing device, damper, or pressure regulator located in a ter-
minal unit may generate noise as the energy expended in pressure
reduction is converted to sound. This is why oversizing of terminal
air devices is undesirable. Large-volume terminals (>2000 cfm
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐33
[950 L/s]) and those with higher pressure differentials produce
greater noise levels. Pressure-reducing devices should be installed in
the duct system with sufficient downstream ductwork to absorb the
sound generated by the device. Large terminal units with pres-
sure-reducing devices should not be installed in occupied spaces
without considering acoustical treatment downstream and in the
radiated sound path from the terminal to the room.
Sound can travel through ductwork from one room to another.
For example, an air-conditioning system that serves a series of
music practice rooms will require ductwork with sound baffles
between rooms, lined ducts, or ample duct turns to attenuate noise.
Noise control will influence duct configuration, size, and system
static pressure.
The sound produced by room terminal equipment cannot be
easily reduced. Control of this potential problem starts with system
selection and entails careful equipment selection and sizing to
achieve the noise criteria for a given conditioned space. The more
moving parts in a terminal, the noisier it will be. Air-cooled unitary
terminal equipment is likely to be near the high end of the noise
scale. Water-cooled terminals, including water-source unitary ter-
minals, can be significantly quieter. Air terminal equipment, in
ascending order of noisiness, include air diffusers, variable-air-vol-
ume boxes, fan-coil units, high-induction-ratio terminals, and pack-
aged terminal air conditioners. Continuous terminal noise is usually
less annoying than intermittent or alternating noise. Thus, ON/OFF
control of terminal refrigeration equipment and air-circulating fans
may produce annoyance even though the sound pressure level dur-
ing equipment operation is within acceptable limits.
Terminal equipment, because of its location, provides the few-
est options for acoustical mitigation. The solution is essentially in
the selection of the equipment itself. Greater opportunities for noise
control through attenuation (e.g., duct lining) and barriers (e.g.,
solid ceilings) are possible when terminal equipment can be located
outside the occupied space (for example, placing air-mixing boxes
above a ceiling with low-velocity ducts connecting to diffusers). Air
ducts passing through adjacent rooms can be transmission channels
for cross-talk, as can unsealed openings around ducts or pipes.
Cross-talk through such paths can be controlled through building
design. Occasionally, partitioning will be located so as to divide a
room terminal or outlet. This creates a virtually uncontrollable path
for sound transmission between rooms.
34⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
Even inherently noisy terminal equipment can be engineered to
meet acceptable noise levels for most applications. Different prod-
ucts vary in their acoustical performance. Often such equipment is
not acoustically rated, at least not on a basis that permits compari-
son with other equipment using catalog data. When in doubt, con-
sider visiting operating installations or arranging for prototype
testing to ensure that the design objectives can be met.
Vibration from fans, pumps, refrigeration compressors, and
other moving equipment must be kept within tolerable levels. As in
the case of sound, degrees of satisfaction vary depending upon the
function of an occupied space. Extraordinary precautions must be
taken to protect sensitive areas, such as those housing electron
microscopes or research animal colonies.
Vibration from imbalanced forces produced by a fan wheel and
drive, unless suitably isolated, will pass undiminished into the
structure and be transmitted to occupied spaces, where less stiff
building members (centerpoints of structural spans, windowpanes,
a chandelier in a ballroom) may respond with noticeable secondary
vibrations. The ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications contains
valuable guidance regarding the isolation of moving equipment.
Every member of the building design team must contribute
toward achieving a satisfactory acoustical (including sound and
vibration) environment. It is up to the HVAC&R design engineer to
alert the other parties to their role in this endeavor relative to
HVAC&R equipment.
2.5.4 Central Versus Local Systems
Central HVAC systems generally include centralized source
equipment (chillers, boilers, cooling towers, and perhaps air-han-
dling units) and decentralized or distributed zone equipment. Local
systems include window air conditioners, packaged heat pumps,
and unitary or water-cooled packaged units without central source
equipment. Centralized equipment requires a few large spaces,
while decentralized equipment requires smaller spaces per equip-
ment unit but more of them.
Central boiler and chiller plants use industrial or large com-
mercial-grade equipment. Such larger equipment is usually more
efficient than smaller local equipment units. Major maintenance can
be done in one location, away from occupied areas. The integration
of heat recovery from one system to another is facilitated. Central
plant equipment can be sited in one or more locations within a
building, with hot water or steam and chilled water distributed from
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐35
the central equipment room to air-handling units, fan-coils, or other
devices throughout the building. A central system provides better
opportunities for vibration and noise control since the major equip-
ment need not be located in or near occupied areas. Zone control is
provided by terminal units, VAV or mixing boxes, control valves, or
dampers, depending upon system design.
Local systems can provide room or zone control without any
central equipment, but this approach may be noisier, present more
equipment service problems, and interfere with occupant activities
in the spaces. Local (stand-alone) equipment is generally of lower
quality, has a more limited useful life, and, in the case of room air
conditioners and other unitary equipment, is often deficient in
humidification and outdoor air control capabilities. In some cases, it
may be difficult or impossible to provide outdoor air for ventilation
to stand-alone units because they are located remote from an out-
door air source.
Local cooling units require either air- or water-cooled condens-
ers. They can be readily moved from one location to another if
changes in building use require it. It is often simpler to relocate
stand-alone units than to modify extensive duct and piping systems.
Stand-alone units, however, may have a great impact on the build-
ing facade via numerous louvers connecting the condenser elements
to the ambient air heat sink. Nevertheless, local systems are com-
monly used with a number of building types where fully indepen-
dent control, low cost, and limited distribution networks are
desirable and access to outdoor air is not a problem.
A closed-loop water-to-air heat pump system (see Chapter 7)
involves individual refrigeration compressors, wherein heat is trans-
ferred from units in the cooling mode to the water loop, making the
heat available to units that may be operating in the heating mode.
While the coefficient of performance (COP) of an individual heat
pump may not be as high as that of central equipment, a closed-loop
heat pump system can be more efficient as a system on a seasonal
basis. These systems often require a supplemental boiler to supply
heat when heating demand exceeds coincidental heat rejection from
units in the cooling mode, and a cooling tower to reject heat when
most units are in cooling mode. A ground-source heat pump system
(Chapter 9) takes this interconnected looping concept a step further.
2.6 COMPUTERS AND HVAC&R DESIGN
Low-cost personal computers have significantly changed the
way practicing engineers design HVAC&R systems. Computers are
36⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
routinely used for load calculations, energy simulations, duct and
pipe sizing, cost estimates, and the preparation of construction
drawings, as well as for office accounting and word processing of
correspondence, reports, and specifications. Facility with computer-
aided drafting software is becoming a prerequisite for many entry-
level engineering positions. Familiarity with simulation packages is
usually a plus when applying for entry or more advanced positions.
The most common (virtually universal) use of computers in
most design offices is for the production of drawings and specifi-
cations. In most offices, software programs are also routinely used
to calculate design heating and cooling loads. Such programs are
an important analysis tool and, for maximum utility, must have
the capacity to handle a large number of thermal zones. Other
multiparameter calculations, such as the sizing of ductwork and
piping networks and the analysis of sprinkler loops, can also be
handled by specialized software. Unfortunately, computer pro-
grams are less commonly used for “what-if” analyses, that is, to
help make complex design decisions. Many HVAC systems are
selected based upon the past experience of the designer and the
lowest first cost, not upon detailed energy studies combined with
life-cycle cost analyses of alternative systems. This is not an
acceptable practice for high-performance buildings.
2.7 CODES AND STANDARDS
All building design efforts are subject to codes—including the
design of HVAC&R systems. Codes are laws or ordinances or other
types of regulations that specify government-mandated minimum
requirements for certain aspects of the design and construction of
buildings. All states in the United States and all Canadian provinces
have building codes. Many large US municipalities have promul-
gated local building codes, which are generally stricter than (or dif-
fer in some respect from) the state codes over which they take
precedence. Many US state and local building codes follow one of
the historic model codes issued by the Building Officials and Code
Administrators International (BOCA), International Conference of
Building Officials (ICBO), or the Southern Building Code Con-
gress International (SBCC). The model code picture has changed
recently with the promulgation of the International Building Code
series of model codes, which is a collaborative effort of the afore-
mentioned code bodies (ICC). State and local building codes affect
HVAC&R design in several ways. They may, for example, specify
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐37
minimum efficiencies for equipment, minimum ventilation rates,
and various measures for fire and smoke control.
It is becoming increasingly common for clients to require
green building certification for selected projects, which will require
the design team to address the U.S. Green Building Council’s
(USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED®) Green Building Rating System™. Federal government
buildings are not subject to state or local codes, but the designer
must follow applicable regulations issued by the General Services
Administration (often referred to simply as GSA) or the responsible
federal department or agency. If state or local codes do not provide
appropriate guidance, use ASHRAE or other suitable standards or
guidelines to establish a good design practice benchmark. Consult
the “Codes and Standards” chapter in the back of each volume of
the ASHRAE Handbook.
Codes and standards pertaining to energy conservation are of
special importance to HVAC&R design. Foremost among these
are ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1, Energy Standard for
Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings; ANSI/ASHRAE
Standard 90.2, Energy-Efficient Design of Low-Rise Residential
Buildings; and ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 100, Energy Con-
servation in Existing Buildings, and various state and model
energy codes. Standard 90.1 was first issued in 1975 and has been
revised numerous times during the ensuing 30 years. In its current
form (Standard 90.1-2007), the standard presents two different
compliance approaches for building design. Under the prescrip-
tive approach, a designer follows a clearly defined methodology
using explicitly stated performance targets for mechanical equip-
ment, lighting, and building envelope assemblies. If a designer
wants more flexibility to employ innovative design strategies or
make trade-offs between systems and strategies, the energy cost
budget approach is available. Using this option, a designer simu-
lates the energy performance of a proposed building design and
compares it to the performance of a comparable building meeting
the requirements of the prescriptive method. Actual energy costs
or utility rates in force at the location of the proposed building
must be used in the calculations. If the annual energy cost of the
proposed building design is no greater than that of the building as
designed by the prescriptive approach, the building is deemed to
comply with the standard. The performance approach allows for
greater design flexibility; this, however, requires much more
design and analysis effort than the prescriptive method. Consult-
38⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
ing fees should support the level of effort required to implement
the performance approach to compliance.
Although originally written as a standard for good design and
not as a legal document, Standard 90.1 (or parts of it) has been
incorporated by reference into the building codes of virtually all
states in the United States. Since the standard is often updated
more frequently than state adopting legislation, verify for each
project whether a particular state energy code refers to the latest
version of Standard 90.1 or to an earlier version. As with building
codes in general, several states (notably California and Florida)
have developed their own energy codes that differ to some extent
from Standard 90.1 in terms of requirements and compliance.
These codes take precedence over Standard 90.1 in those states.
Likewise, Canadian building and energy codes will generally
apply in the Canadian provinces.
Standard 90.2 was developed to provide energy-efficient
design requirements for most residential buildings. Standard 90.2
provides similar compliance options as Standard 90.1, as well as
providing for an intermediate “trade-off” approach. This standard
has not been as widely adopted as Standard 90.1, however, so the
mechanical designer will likely encounter the International
Energy Conservation Code (ICC) or its predecessor, Model
Energy Code, in residential work. Standard 100 provides energy
efficiency guidance for design work involving existing buildings.
An interesting recent trend has been an attempt to design to bet-
ter-than-minimum energy standards (often to obtain green build-
ing certification). See the Advanced Energy Design Guide for
Small Office Buildings (ASHRAE 2004a) for guidance in this
aspect of design.
Other codes of major importance to an HVAC designer are the
national fire codes—especially NFPA 90A, Installation of Air Con-
ditioning and Ventilation Systems, and NFPA 92A, Recommended
Practice for Smoke-Control Systems. It is good practice to follow
the provisions of these model codes when local requirements are
less stringent or do not exist. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2004,
Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, and
ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2007, Ventilation for Acceptable
Indoor Air Quality (ASHRAE 2007a), provide minimum accept-
able design criteria for comfort and indoor air quality and should be
consulted for every project. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2007,
Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Low-Rise Resi-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐39
dential Buildings (ASHRAE 2007b), deals with indoor air quality
in residential buildings.
2.8 ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
2.8.1 Overview
No practical engineering design can be independent of econom-
ics. The type of economic analysis to be used, however, strongly
depends upon the criteria of the client, which must be ascertained
before the HVAC&R engineer begins an economic analysis.
The developer of a speculative building is primarily concerned
with first cost, and concern with operating costs may vary from
minor to none. On the other hand, an institutional client who
expects to own and occupy a building over its entire useful life is
frequently willing to accept additional first costs if these result in
operating cost savings. On many projects, the United States govern-
ment requires a life-cycle cost analysis (covering capital, operating,
and maintenance costs and including the effects of interest and cost
escalation). Industrial or commercial clients may want to know the
rate of return on investment (termed ROI). NIST Handbook 135,
Life-Cycle Costing Manual for the Federal Energy Management
Program, is a good resource for the basics of life-cycle costing.
In addition to determining the client’s preferred method of anal-
ysis, it is critical to ascertain the client’s usual or preferred financial
assumptions, such as projected rates of inflation, discount rates, fuel
cost escalation rates, and similar data. Using the methods and data
generally assumed by the client for financial projections makes an
economic analysis more applicable and avoids subsequent criticisms
and objections relative to such necessary assumptions.
Regardless of the method of financial analysis used, annual
costs for each air-conditioning system under consideration must
be determined. Items that should be considered are listed in the
“Owning and Operating Costs” chapter in the ASHRAE Hand-
book—HVAC Applications. For a realistic analysis, the costs of
maintenance and repairs, which may be difficult to obtain, should
be included in the economic analysis—especially if they are
expected to differ substantially between alternative systems or
equipment. Frequently, manufacturers either do not have such
information or are reluctant to divulge it. Potential sources for this
type of information include operators of equipment similar or
identical to that being designed, operators of other buildings occu-
pied by the client, and publications of the Building Owners and
40⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
Managers Association (BOMA). The Hartford Steam Boiler
Inspection and Insurance Company has also collected much useful
data related to equipment failure.
2.8.2 Economic Indicators
Simple Payback Period. This indicator is sometimes used to
determine whether a particular additional first cost is warranted by
projected savings in operating costs. The first year’s annual savings
are divided into the additional first cost to obtain the simple pay-
back period (in years) to recoup the estimated investment. While
the method is very straightforward, it ignores the time value of
money (interest or discount rate). It should be used only for periods
not exceeding three to five years. It can be modified by discounting
savings occurring in future years (see below).
Discounted Cash Flow. Revenues (or savings) and costs are
calculated separately for each year over the assumed lifetime of a
building, piece of equipment, or strategy. They are then discounted
and summed to a specified year, usually either the first or the last
year of the analysis period. The discount factor takes into account
the time value of money. If all costs are referred to the first year, the
discount factor for the rth year is 1/(1 + i)r, where i is the discount
rate in decimal form (a 6% rate would be 0.06). If costs are referred
to the last year, the discount factor for the rth year is (1 + i)n–r,
where n is the number of years over which the analysis extends.
Net Present Value (NPV). The NPV is the difference between
the present value of revenues and the present value of costs. It is the
sum of all annual discounted cash flows referred to the first year of
the analysis. The higher the NPV the more desirable a project, sub-
ject to the initial cash limitations of the investor.
Life-Cycle Cost (LCC). This is the discounted cash flow,
including first cost, operating costs, maintenance costs, and any sal-
vage value, usually referenced to the last year of the analysis.
Life-cycle costing is required on many federal government projects.
Profitability Index. The profitability index is defined as the
ratio of the net benefit to the net cost. It can be expressed as (NPV +
C)/C, where C is the total initial investment. This index normalizes
the total benefits to a single unit of invested capital. It is a useful
concept for making choices among different projects when the
amount of available capital for investment is limited.
Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The IRR is the discount rate
that makes the NPV equal to zero. It is obtained by iterative calcu-
lations once the cash flow stream has been identified. Because the
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐41
IRR is a percentage, it is intuitively easy to communicate to a
broad variety of clients. An investor may have a “hurdle rate,”
which is the minimum acceptable rate of return for a project. If
the IRR is higher than that, the project will be undertaken; if it is
not, the investor will balk.
After-Tax Analysis. An after-tax analysis includes the effects of
taxes, particularly income taxes, on the financial aspects of the
project. These have to be calculated for each year before discount-
ing, as illustrated in the “Owning and Operating Costs” chapter in
the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications.
Levelized Cost. This method is generally used only by public
utilities, since their rates are set based upon an allowable return on
investment. It does not usually apply to private sector analyses.
Economic analyses may be performed either in current (nomi-
nal) dollars or in constant dollars (where the effects of inflation are
removed). Constant dollar analyses are generally easier to use and,
for that reason, are often preferred. Many economists also believe
that they yield a more accurate picture of the financial viability of a
project. However, since certain tax items, such as depreciation, are
always given in current dollars, after-tax financial analyses must be
conducted in current dollars.
In private investment analysis, the discount rate is generally
based upon the investor’s cost of capital or required rate of return.
This rate may be increased to account for technological uncertain-
ties or perceived risks. In public investment analysis, the discount
rate should be at least equal to the cost of borrowing money on the
part of the government agency plus an amount representing the
public’s lost opportunity cost (by the purchasers of the govern-
ment bonds).
2.8.3 Rentable Area
The rentable area of a tenant-occupied building is the basis for
determining income potential. Full-service leases, including utility
costs, are based upon this parameter. The rentable area may be
defined in the lease, sometimes by reference to a standard, such as
that of BOMA. Strangely, many leases fail to define the term, and it
becomes defined by the established practice in an individual build-
ing by default. Significant disparity can occur among buildings in
the same region. For an office building, the definition will vary
somewhat depending upon whether a floor is leased to single or to
multiple tenants. For single tenants, the rentable area is often mea-
sured from the inside surface of the exterior walls less any areas
42⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
connecting with and serving other floors, such as stairs, elevator
shafts, ducts, and pipe shafts. Toilet rooms, mechanical equipment
rooms serving the floor, janitorial closets, electrical closets, and
column spaces are included in the rentable area. For multiple ten-
ants on one floor, the term usually excludes public corridors, lob-
bies, toilet rooms, mechanical equipment rooms, etc.
2.8.4 Space Utilization
The ratio of net rentable space to gross building area (spatial
efficiency) is an important indicator of the profitability of a build-
ing. Building construction costs are related to the gross area,
whereas income potential relates to the rentable area. The ratio usu-
ally ranges from 90% to 75%—and tends to be higher for larger
buildings. This ratio can be significant in the economic evaluation
of air-conditioning alternatives. The air-conditioned area—which
relates most closely to mechanical equipment initial and operating
costs—may be similar to the single-tenant rentable area defined
previously. Construction costs, including mechanical costs, how-
ever, are reported on the basis of gross building area. Therefore, if
such cost information is to be used for budgeting of initial cost,
gross area should be used to create a total construction cost model.
On the other hand, operating costs may be more realistically based
upon rentable area.
To some degree, a building's air-conditioning system can influ-
ence the ratio of rentable area to gross area. While equipment
located on the floor under windows may occupy otherwise usable
space, this space is almost always included in the rentable area.
Thus, no reduction in income results from the use of underwindow
units. If air-conditioning equipment to serve each floor is located in
a mechanical equipment room on that floor, such space may also be
included in the net rentable area. Compare this concept to a central
system serving an entire building from a rooftop penthouse through
supply and return duct shaftways. Due to the method by which rent-
able area is defined, the penthouse and the shaftway space may be
considered non-revenue-producing. Thus, paradoxically, even
though more total building area and perceptually more valuable
space may be used by locating equipment on the tenant floor than
by putting it in a rooftop penthouse and using duct risers, the decen-
tralized arrangement could result in more revenue and a better net
return for the construction cost investment.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐43
2.8.5 Public Utility Tariffs (Rate Schedules)
The design engineer must be familiar with the details of the tar-
iffs of the local electric utility (and the gas utility if gas service is
contemplated for the building). This is necessary for a detailed
analysis of operating costs, and it enables the designer to look for
ways to take advantage of the utility rate structure to decrease these
costs. Sometimes advantageous rates can be negotiated with the
local utility if special conditions exist (such as off-peak loading
resulting from thermal storage or an agreement to shed loads during
times of peak demand).
Most utility tariffs for nonresidential buildings consist of a cus-
tomer charge, a demand charge, and an energy charge. Few resi-
dential tariffs include demand charges, primarily because of the
relatively high cost of demand meters. The customer charge is a flat
monthly “service” charge. The energy charge is an overall con-
sumption charge per kilowatt-hour (or Btu or cubic foot of gas)
used. It may be a flat charge or a decreasing block charge in which
the cost per unit of energy decreases as monthly use increases or an
increasing block charge in which the opposite occurs. Some tariffs
make the energy charge a function, among other variables, of the
monthly demand.
The demand charge is based upon the highest monthly draw
that a customer makes on the utility network (electric kW or gas
Btu/h), usually measured at 15- or 30-minute intervals. Some utili-
ties calculate their monthly charges on a billing demand that is
never less than a certain fraction of the highest demand during the
previous 12 months (called a ratchet clause). Thus, a high air-condi-
tioning demand during a particularly hot summer day may raise
utility costs for a customer for an entire year. It is thus beneficial to
investigate methods of avoiding simultaneous operation of high-
demand equipment, if that is feasible. Thermal storage (see Section
9.2) and control strategies (see Section 9.3 and Chapter 10) are
methods of accomplishing this; they may also contribute to a reduc-
tion in time-of-use charges.
Time-of-use charges, in which demand and/or energy rates
depend upon the time of day during which they are made, have
become more prevalent. Some utilities have even introduced them
for their residential customers. Generally, rates are higher during
periods of heavy use (on-peak, daytime) and lower during periods
of light use (off-peak, nighttime). Some utilities reduce or waive
their demand charges during off-peak periods. These periods may
44⏐ THE DESIGN PROCESS
be nights, weekends, or even entire seasons of low demand, such as
the summer months for gas use. Thus, time-of-use or other charges
may differ from summer to winter.

3.1 CONTEXT
One of the first steps in designing an air-conditioning system
is to establish comfort and health criteria for the various spaces in
the building. These criteria support the established design intent
and should become part of the Owner’s Project Requirements
document. Such criteria should include space temperature and
humidity, air speed surrounding occupants, mean radiant tempera-
ture (MRT), indoor air quality requirements, and sound and vibra-
tion levels. The selection of appropriate design criteria will be
influenced by a number of conditions: the ages and activities of
the occupants, the occupant density, and the contaminants likely
to be present in the spaces. The physical character of the space
can have some bearing on occupant comfort. For example, surface
temperatures of walls and floors can affect thermal comfort and
influence the design space temperature. Assumptions regarding
occupant clothing will influence comfort criteria.
The designer must also consider economic parameters. A bal-
ance frequently must be sought between optimum environmental
conditions and system performance capabilities on the one hand
and first and life-cycle cost targets on the other. There are usually
numerous equipment and system solutions to any given intent/crite-
ria set. Also, carefully consider the construction and operating com-
plexity of the system concepts. Design objectives will have but a
slim chance of being realized if system design features reach
beyond the capabilities or understanding of operating and mainte-
nance staff (assuming there is such staff). This point cannot be
overemphasized and deserves serious discussion with both client
and contractor at an early stage.

3.2 THERMAL COMFORT
3.2.1 Thermal Environmental Conditions
Satisfaction with the thermal environment is based upon a
complex subjective response to several interacting variables. The
design, construction, and use of an occupied space, as well as the
design, construction, and operation of its HVAC systems, will
determine the extent of satisfaction with the thermal environment.
Not all individuals perceive a given thermal environment with the
same degree of acceptability. The perception of comfort relates to
an individual’s physical condition, bodily heat exchange with the
surroundings, and physiological characteristics. The heat exchange
between an individual and his/her surroundings is influenced by
•
dry-bulb air temperature,
•
relative humidity (RH),
•
thermal radiation (solar and mean radiant),
•
air movement,
•
extent of clothing,
•
activity level, and
•
direct contact with surfaces not at body temperature.
While ideal thermal conditions are difficult to define for any
one individual in a particular setting due to personal preferences,
Standard 55 (see below) specifies conditions likely to be thermally
acceptable to at least 80% of the adult occupants in a space. A more
complete explanation of the limits of these conditions, factors affect-
ing comfort, and methods for their determination and measurement
can be found in Standard 55 and in the “Physiological Principles for
Comfort and Health” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Funda-
mentals. It is important to remember that thermal comfort is more
than just a response to temperature.
3.2.2 Temperature and Humidity
The design space temperature and humidity for both heating
and cooling seasons should be based on Standard 55 for most appli-
cations. The standard establishes a comfort zone (Figure 3-1) for
people in winter and summer clothing engaged in primarily seden-
tary activities (1.2 met). If a designer selects values from the center
of the comfort envelopes, temperatures of 77°F [25.0°C] for sum-
mer and 72°F [22.2°C] for winter are the likely choices, with RH
values of 45% and 50%, respectively. With respect to energy effi-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐49

human comfort from Standard 55 [(a) I-P units; (b) SI units].
(a)

50⏐ OCCUPANT COMFORT AND HEALTH
ciency, the use of design values that are within, but on the fringes
of, the ASHRAE comfort zone makes sense. At the fringes, careful
attention must be paid to the effects of the other comfort variables
lest discomfort result from draft or MRT.
As the comfort chart (Figure 3-1) indicates, RH does not have a
significant bearing on thermal comfort in most situations as long as
the space dry-bulb temperature is within the comfort range. RH,
though, does affect odor perceptibility and respiratory health.
Because of these considerations, 40% to 50% RH is a preferred
design range. Maintaining humidity within this range during winter,
however, is complicated by (1) energy use considerations, (2) the
risk of condensation on windows and window frames during cold
weather, (3) the risk of condensation within the exterior building
envelope, and (4) the need to provide and maintain humidifying
equipment within the air-conditioning system. The economic value
of winter humidity control for occupant well-being is not always
appreciated by designers. Significantly reduced absenteeism among
children, office workers, and army recruits as a result of winter
humidification has been reported (Green 1979, 1982). Where win-
ter humidification is provided for comfort, a minimum RH of 30%
is generally acceptable. This value may need to be reduced during
extremely cold outdoor conditions—below 0°F [–17.8°C].
If a higher humidity is acceptable under summer conditions,
considerable energy savings can be realized, as shown in
Figure 3-2. To determine an approximate value of the energy used
for dehumidification at a constant 78°F [25.6°C] dry-bulb tempera-
ture, enter the annual wet-bulb degree-hours above 66°F [18.9°C] at
the bottom left, intersect this value with a chosen indoor RH, then
draw a vertical line to the weekly hours of cooling system operation
and read the energy used on the upper-left scale. Repeating this pro-
cedure for a different value of RH yields the energy savings obtain-
able by raising RH. Be cautious, however, about choosing
excessively high humidities. Computer rooms (particularly their
printers), photocopy rooms, and drafting rooms/studios are exam-
ples of spaces where RH in excess of 50%–55% is undesirable or
unacceptable. To prevent the growth of mold and mildew, RH
should be maintained below 60%.
Air speed and MRT are environmental variables that will affect
thermal comfort and can be used to enhance comfort potential
while reducing energy use. See Section 3.4 for further discussion of
air motion. MRT can be thought of as the weighted average surface
temperature of the surroundings. MRT varies as surface tempera-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐51
tures change, varies from location to location within a space, and
affects heat transfer to/from occupants via radiation. Although
MRT conditions usually result from architectural decisions (such as
glazing type or wall/roof R-values), MRT can drastically impact
occupant comfort and must be considered during the design of
HVAC systems.

and Long 1978).
52⏐ OCCUPANT COMFORT AND HEALTH
3.2.3 Zoning Considerations
Even when appropriate design conditions (primarily tempera-
tures) are selected, they are achievable only through the actions of
appropriate space control instrumentation and then only within
variations determined by the control band of that instrumentation
(see Chapter 10). Furthermore, the larger the control zone (and the
distance from occupant to controller) and the more diverse the ther-
mal load characteristics within the zone, the more the selected
parameters affecting occupant comfort will vary.
The obvious desirability of individual occupant control of ther-
mal conditions is usually compromised by the physical arrange-
ment of a space, the mobility of the occupants, the inherent system
capabilities, and the high cost of providing a temperature control
zone for each person. The degree of compromise is an important
design concern. A single zone (one thermostat to control space tem-
perature) throughout a commercial building is not appropriate and
will guarantee low occupant satisfaction. This is especially true if
the building is compartmented, as in an office building.
Each compartmented space (room) can become a control zone
if provided with a thermostat (or other control device) and a means
of regulation to produce the proper heating and/or cooling capacity
to maintain the desired room conditions. If separate systems pro-
vide heating and cooling (such as an overhead air system for cool-
ing and perimeter fin-tube radiation for heating), one of the
following control methods may be used:
•
Coordinated thermostat control of both heating and cooling
systems.
•
Independent space temperature controls for each system,
although this method risks control “fighting” and energy waste
if the heating setpoint is higher than the cooling setpoint.
•
Local zone control of one system while control of the other
system is grouped to serve several zones with common load
characteristics—such as all zones sharing the same exposure.
The last alternative is often used in office buildings. For exam-
ple, supply air terminals may be provided for each office module,
but the perimeter heating system for an entire building (or for sepa-
rate exposures of a building) may be controlled from a common
point. Attempting to both cool and heat a number of perimeter
rooms with different solar exposures and potentially diverse thermal
characteristics from a single control device is not recommended.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐53
Whenever possible, rooms that require the same environmental
conditions should be grouped in a single zone. This simplifies the
system design and makes it less costly to install and operate. On the
other hand, interior and perimeter spaces should almost always be
on separate systems or control zones because of the disparity of
their thermal loads. Rapid cycling of space temperature—as can
occur with ON/OFF control—is yet another system and control con-
sideration that can affect occupant comfort.
Decisions regarding zoning requirements and the related cost
implications must be resolved through the collaboration of the
design team, the owners, and, if feasible, the prospective tenants.
Appropriate zoning is critical to occupant comfort and HVAC sys-
tem success. In addition to defining the size of temperature control
zones, the degree of control desired has considerable impact on the
selection of the air-conditioning system.
3.3 INDOOR AIR QUALITY
Acceptable indoor air quality is defined by Standard 62.1 as
“air in which there are no known contaminants at harmful concen-
trations... and with which a substantial majority (80% or more) of
the people exposed do not express dissatisfaction.” ASHRAE
addresses indoor air quality both through Standard 62.1 (nonresi-
dential) and Standard 62.2 (residential). These standards focus
upon ventilation but also deal with filtration. They do not expressly
consider reduction of pollutants at the source.
The term ventilation is often used to refer specifically to out-
door air introduced into a conditioned space, not to the total amount
of air supplied to the space. The definition of ventilation from Stan-
dard 62.1, however, is “the process of supplying air to or removing
air from a space for the purpose of controlling air contamination
levels, humidity, or temperature within the space.” This word must
be used with caution.
When a quantity of ventilation air is specified, it typically
refers to the outdoor air portion only—except in special cases
defined in Standard 62.1. The total amount of air supplied to a par-
ticular space is generally determined by the cooling load require-
ments of the space, subject to the minimum ventilation airflow
specified in applicable codes or standards for that type of space.
3.3.1 Ventilation Techniques
The purpose of ventilation for indoor air quality is to introduce
contaminant-free air into an occupied space at a rate and in a man-
54⏐ OCCUPANT COMFORT AND HEALTH
ner sufficient to dilute or remove contaminants generated within the
space to a satisfactory degree relative to occupant comfort and
health. Buildings are usually ventilated by supplying filtered out-
door air through the HVAC system. Different HVAC systems pos-
sess different capabilities to meet ventilation requirements.
Natural airflow through open windows or through infiltration is
the ventilation method of choice for many residences and other
small buildings. Such airflow is variable, however, and (to a large
measure) hard to quantify and control. Cooling (and indoor air
quality) systems designed to utilize natural ventilation are common
in Europe, but they are rare in the United States. Mechanical venti-
lation dominates design in the United States.
Local and general exhaust systems usually complement a ven-
tilation system by containing and removing selected contaminants
at the source, as is the case with a bathroom exhaust. It is common
practice to supply sufficient outdoor air through an air-conditioning
system to make up for air that is exhausted plus an additional
amount of air to provide building pressurization to offset infiltra-
tion. Energy considerations generally suggest that the ventilation air
supply not be increased above the amount needed for dilution of
contaminants, except to balance exhaust airflow and provide nomi-
nal pressurization. Large-scale infiltration is more effectively lim-
ited by ensuring reasonable tightness of the building envelope.
Ventilation is not the only means of limiting contaminant lev-
els, and it should not be considered a cure-all. Filtration, for exam-
ple, is discussed in Section 3.3.4. Source control, where practicable,
is most effective. Building materials, such as carpet and wall cover-
ings, should be selected for low emission of volatile organic com-
pounds. Physical containment or segregation of emission sources
may be appropriate. Indeed, control of some sources may be
beyond the capabilities of even a well-designed ventilation system.
The objectives and capabilities of a proposed ventilation system
should be understood by all who are concerned with the construc-
tion and operation of the building.
3.3.2 Indoor Air Contaminants
To better understand the methods for controlling indoor air
contamination, the designer should understand the general nature of
such contaminants. Indoor air contaminants can be solids, liquids,
or gases (vapors). Some can be irritants or odiferous, thus affecting
occupant comfort. The same contaminants at higher concentrations,
as well as others of which occupants may be unaware, can pose
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐55
health risks. People vary in their sensitivity to contaminants.
Minute concentrations of certain fungi and other impurities can
cause serious discomfort and impairment in sensitive individuals
while not affecting most occupants. Standards for vapors specify a
quantity of pollutant per unit volume of air, in parts per million
(ppm). Standards for particles often specify the mass concentration
of particles expressed in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3). The
standards typically include all particle sizes—the total suspended
particulate concentration (TSP). Large particles are filtered by the
nasal passages and generally cause no adverse physiological
response unless they are allergenic or pathogenic. Smaller, respira-
ble suspended particles (RSP) are important because they can lodge
in the lungs. Respirable particles range in size up to 5 µm.
Particles of specific interest include:
•
Respirable particulates as a group
•
Tobacco smoke (solid and liquid droplets), which also contains
many gases (note that Standard 62.1 explicitly assumes that
there is no environmental tobacco smoke in establishing typical
ventilation rates)
•
Asbestos fibers
•
Allergens (pollen, fungi, mold spores, and insect feces and
parts)
•
Pathogens (bacteria and viruses), which are almost always con-
tained in or on other particulate matter
Gasses/vapors of interest include:
•
Carbon dioxide (CO2)
•
Carbon monoxide (CO)
•
Radon (decay products become attached to solids)
•
Formaldehyde (HCHO)
•
Other volatile organic compounds (VOCs)—comprising a wide
range of specific compounds
Some contaminants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), are brought
in along with outdoor air via mechanical ventilation or infiltration.
Other contaminants found in outdoor air, such as nitrogen oxides
and carbon monoxide, may have indoor sources as well. Most
indoor pollutants, however, emanate from inside sources. People
are sources of CO2, biomatter, and other contaminants character-
ized as “body odors.” People's activities (cleaning, cooking, gluing,
refinishing furniture, photocopying, etc.) also cause pollution.
Building materials and finishes can “outgas” or “offgas” pollutants.
56⏐ OCCUPANT COMFORT AND HEALTH
Furnishings, business machines, and appliances (particularly
unvented or poorly vented wood- and fossil-fuel-burning heaters
and stoves) can be contaminant sources. The soil surrounding a
building can be a source of radon and/or pesticides that enter the
building through cracks, drains, or diffusion. Standard 62.1 speci-
fies maximum concentration levels of common indoor contami-
nants. It also sets forth acceptable quality parameters for outdoor air
used for building ventilation. If the outdoor air source exceeds the
allowable contaminant parameters, it must be cleaned or purified
prior to introduction into occupied spaces.
Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems, plumbing
systems, and poor construction or maintenance practices can pro-
duce “environmental niches” where pathogenic or allergenic organ-
isms can collect and multiply to then be introduced into the air. An
additional complicating factor in the buildup of contaminants is the
variation in dilution rates and effectiveness of the ventilation deliv-
ery systems often found in buildings. Contaminant concentrations
vary spatially as well as over time. These variations add further
nonuniformity to pollutant concentrations.
3.3.3 Determination of Ventilation Rate
Standard 62.1 provides the designer with a means of determin-
ing ventilation rates needed to achieve acceptable indoor air quality.
The standard offers the designer two procedures for determining the
required ventilation rate—the ventilation rate procedure and the
indoor air quality procedure.
The ventilation rate procedure provides prescriptive rates, usu-
ally on the basis of cfm [L/s] of outdoor air per occupant and unit
area of floor, for an array of applications. Unless unusual pollutants
are present, these rates are intended to produce acceptable indoor
air quality. The basis for the occupancy ventilation rates is an
underlying minimum outdoor airflow per occupant as a means of
controlling CO2 to a concentration of 1000 ppm. Although CO2 per
se is not a contaminant of concern at this low concentration, it is an
easily measurable surrogate for other contaminants, such as body
odors. The indoor air quality procedure offers an analytical alterna-
tive, allowing the designer to determine the ventilation rate based
upon knowledge of the contaminants being generated within the
space and the capability of the ventilation air supply to limit them
to acceptable levels.
While Standard 62 contains guidelines concerning maximum
concentrations of some pollutants, “threshold limit values” for
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐57
industrial applications and other pollutants are published by the
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists
(ACGIH 1992). Frequently, local building and occupational codes
prescribe threshold limit values and ventilation rates. When they are
more stringent than current ASHRAE and ACGIH recommenda-
tions, they must be followed unless waived by the governing
authority; when they are less stringent, the ASHRAE (or ACGIH)
guidelines are recommended since they generally represent a more
recent consensus of expert opinion on the subject and may carry
legal weight.
3.3.4 Air Cleaning
The selection of air filters, gas or vapor removers, or other
methods of air contaminant reduction influences the quality of the
ventilation air supply, the dilution capability of the total air supplied
to the occupied space, the concentration of room air contaminants,
and the resultant occupant health and comfort. Filtration above 50%
efficiency according to the ASHRAE dust-spot determination
(ASHRAE 1992) (equivalent to 10 MERV) must frequently be
installed if the particulate limits established by ACGIH and Stan-
dard 62.1 for ventilation air are to be met. Filters with efficiencies
above 80% dust spot (13 MERV) can be effective in removing a sig-
nificant portion of respirable particulate contaminants. Dust spot
ratings have historically been used to classify filters; minimum effi-
ciency reporting value (MERV) ratings are replacing dust spot rat-
ings (ASHRAE 1999).
When high-efficiency air filters are installed in an air-handling
unit, the total supply airflow helps control particulate concentra-
tions within a space. Consequently, all-air constant-volume systems
(and, to a lesser extent, variable-volume systems), if equipped with
such filters, can produce respirable particulate concentrations in the
building environment that are lower than those achievable by sys-
tems in which the supply airflow rate is solely limited to the ventila-
tion rate (typical of air-and-water systems).
Certain applications demand removal of gaseous contaminants
present in the outdoor air or produced within the conditioned space.
Harmful gases and vapors can be removed by adsorption or oxi-
dization. Activated carbon is the adsorptive material most com-
monly used in HVAC systems. Potassium permanganate
impregnated into the carbon or an alumina base is used to oxidize
certain chemicals for which carbon has limited effectiveness.
Before being incorporated into a design solution, efficacy limita-
58⏐ OCCUPANT COMFORT AND HEALTH
tions, bed depth requirements, and maintenance procedures should
be thoughtfully evaluated in light of the need for such a system.
Air washers (see Section 5.2.3) are also effective in reducing
SO2 and other acid-forming gases. But such scrubbers need contin-
uous maintenance to keep the recirculated water from becoming
highly corrosive and the reservoir a breeding ground for biological
contaminants. Rare-book rooms and valuable artifact display or
storage areas in museums and archival depositories are candidates
for gas removal provisions, but the operations and maintenance
staff should understand that careful maintenance is required for
effective performance. Notwithstanding such gas removal provi-
sions, the ventilation rate in these types of spaces should be main-
tained at no less than 15 cfm [7.1 L/s] per person (except as
otherwise permitted by Standard 62.1) to limit the carbon dioxide
concentration.
3.4 ROOM AIR DISTRIBUTION
3.4.1 Predicting Thermal Comfort
Standard 55 is based upon the presumption (explicitly stated
in early versions of the standard) that “there is no minimum air
movement that is necessary for thermal comfort,” although this is
contrary to the experience of many building operators (see Section
3.4.2). The standard further prescribes a maximum rate of air
movement (air speed) of 30 fpm [0.15 m/s] for winter and 50 fpm
[0.25 m/s] for summer. Those values essentially agree with the
data found in the “Space Air Diffusion “chapter in the ASHRAE
Handbook—Fundamentals.
That chapter of the Handbook describes different methods of
room air distribution. It also presents a space air distribution perfor-
mance index (ADPI), which permits prediction of the comfort
potential that can be achieved with a given supply air distribution
design. The higher the index, the more uniform the conditions of
comfort as determined by temperature variation from a control
value and air velocities at various locations in the occupied zone.
Using the guidance of that chapter, a designer can develop air distri-
bution layouts that are likely to maintain a high probability of ther-
mal comfort. Note that the ADPI concept is based upon research
using a space (or control) temperature of 76°F [24.4°C]. Therefore,
ADPI predictions apply only if the average space temperature is
close to that value. For instance, if a room is maintained at 68°F
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐59
[20.0°C], it is likely to be considered uncomfortably cool even
though the ADPI is quite high.
3.4.2 Minimum Air Motion
Low air velocity affects the ability of a conventional HVAC
system to maintain uniformity of temperature throughout the occu-
pied zone and to dilute contaminants generated within that zone.
Occupant comfort has been reported to suffer as a consequence of
low total supply airflow in a space, even when the space tempera-
ture is well inside the comfort envelope. Because of this, many
designers have adopted a minimum total supply airflow benchmark
of 0.6 to 0.8 cfm/ft2 [3 to 4 L/s per m2] for office applications.
These values are based upon an all-air system with conventional
supply outlets. They can be reduced when outlets with high induc-
tion ratios are employed, since these outlets increase the average
room air motion.
Minimum room air circulation is particularly important in the
case of VAV systems when the conditioned air supply may be
greatly reduced in response to reductions in the sensible cooling
load. VAV systems should generally maintain a minimum supply of
0.35 cfm/ft2 [1.78 L/s m2] in occupied spaces, even when space
cooling loads are low. Fan-powered terminals can be used to main-
tain higher circulation rates during times when space cooling loads
allow minimal conditioned air delivery. Fan-powered terminals can
be used to maintain a minimum circulation rate.
When using outlets with horizontal discharge patterns, con-
sider the following points:
1.
An outlet with a relatively low throw coefficient will produce a
smaller absolute change in throw values with variation in vol-
ume and, thus, tend to minimize changes in air motion within
an occupied space due to changes in air supply.
2.
Choose outlets for relatively small quantities of air. This will
make absolute values of throw vary least with variations in out-
let flow rate. If the application requires modular outlet arrange-
ments for occupancy flexibility, the number of outlets does not
need to be increased.
3.
All outlets have a tolerance in throw and pressure drop that per-
mits their use without concern for small volume reductions.
Not all diffuser types, however, have desirable characteristics
for large volume reductions. To obtain maximum leeway for
airflow reduction, select diffusers for full volume at full capac-
ity and maximum permissible outlet velocity.
60⏐ OCCUPANT COMFORT AND HEALTH
In cold-air systems, air is supplied at low temperatures, e.g.,
less than 50°F [10°C], to reduce both capital and operating costs
compared to systems using conventional supply air temperatures
(see Section 9.3.8). Here again, special care in selecting supply air
terminals is necessary to ensure adequate air circulation and avoid
occupant exposure to cold airstreams.
Another cause of occupant complaints, not always coincident
with uncomfortable space temperature, is shoulder-high partition-
ing. In such layouts, occupants may spend long periods sitting
inside a box that is fully enclosed except at the top. The ventilation
effectiveness of an otherwise excellent space air distribution system
can be defeated by such partitioning. A solution that will yield ade-
quate air motion in the occupied zone (the box) to some extent rests
with the design of the partitioning system. Nonetheless, prime
responsibility for the environmental conditions within such cubicles
rests with the HVAC designer. Maintaining a good rate of air circu-
lation within the overall space will be a partially mitigating factor.
Air distribution in some specific occupancies, such as theaters,
hospital operating rooms, laboratories with exhaust hoods, and
cleanrooms, requires special analyses of both the air supply and the
return or exhaust distribution systems.
Air-and-water systems inherently supply less air to the occu-
pied space than all-air systems. General air circulation is enhanced
by the terminal unit if it is a fan-coil (or induction) unit. Radiant
panel systems do not substantially contribute to air circulation.
3.4.3 Jet Stream Air Distribution
Some all-air systems incorporate air jets that sweep over the
occupant’s workstation. Flow and direction are manually adjustable
to provide individual control. This refined form of spot cooling has
the advantages of reduced cooling load and reduced total airflow.
This application, however, is not common in buildings in North
America.
3.4.4 Return Air
Except in unusual circumstances, return air finds its way back
to the air-handling unit. As a rule, the provisions made for return air
do not materially influence occupant comfort. An exception is the
placement of return air grilles too close to supply air terminals,
which may short-circuit space air distribution. Conversely, locating
a return air inlet over concentrated heat sources (such as high-watt-
age equipment) can help prevent heat buildup around such sources.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐61
Recommended face velocities at return air inlets are given in the
“Duct Design” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals.
3.5 NOISE AND VIBRATION
Air conditioning was once known as the “unseen servant.” To
offer occupants a complete range of comfort, it must be the
“unheard servant” as well. This is true except in those cases where
air-conditioning “noise” is discreetly blended to produce a pleas-
antly balanced background sound level over the audible frequency
range, which then becomes a welcome mask for disagreeable or
distracting noises.
An initial step in HVAC system design is to establish space
noise criteria. These criteria should be communicated to the client
for approval early in the design process. All noise-generating
sources within the air-conditioning system must be identified, and
their sound power output must be controlled or mitigated. Methods
for accomplishing this are described in Section 2.5.3.

4.1 CONTEXT
The accurate calculation of heating and cooling loads is essen-
tial to provide a sound bridge between fundamental building design
decisions and an operating building. If loads are substantially
underestimated, occupants and users will likely be hot or cold. If
loads are substantially overestimated, equipment will be oversized
(usually wasting money, reducing efficiency, increasing energy con-
sumption, and often imperiling comfort). Accurate load calcula-
tions are an important part of the design process. This importance is
underscored by the constant evolution of load calculation method-
ologies—which has steadily made load calculations more complex,
less intuitive, and more dependent upon computers.
It is imperative that a beginning HVAC&R engineer have a good
grasp of the fundamentals of load calculation concepts. Total reliance
upon computer software for load analysis is not wise. The adage
“garbage in, garbage out” applies perfectly well to load calculations.
Equipment and systems are sized from “design” loads, which are
calculated using statistically significant weather conditions that
reflect a building location’s climate. A design heating load represents
heat loss from a building under a series of generally agreed upon
assumptions. A design cooling load represents heat flow into a build-
ing via the building envelope and from internal sources, again under a
commonly accepted set of assumptions. The term heat gain is gener-
ally used to describe undifferentiated heat flow into a building or
space. The term cooling load is used to describe that portion of heat
gain that will affect air (as opposed to building material and content)
temperature at a given point in time. The vast majority of air-condi-
tioning systems respond directly to cooling loads through thermo-
static control (and only indirectly to heat gains).
CHAPTER 4
LOAD CALCULATIONS
64⏐ LOAD CALCULATIONS
Loads are sensible (affecting air temperature) or latent (affect-
ing relative humidity) or a combination of sensible and latent.
Loads may be external (passing through the building envelope) or
internal (originating within the building envelope). Space loads
affect a particular portion of a building at some point in time; equip-
ment loads are those seen by equipment at some point in time.
Equipment loads for central components may not equal the sum of
design space loads due to diversity (noncoincidence) of loads, such
as between east-facing and west-facing rooms.
Sensible and latent heating and cooling loads arise from heat
transfer through the opaque building envelope; solar heat gain
through windows and skylights; infiltration through openings in the
building envelope; internal heat gains due to lighting, people, and
equipment in the conditioned spaces; and outdoor airflow for venti-
lation and building pressurization. These loads are described in
detail in several chapters in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamen-
tals. Typically, design heating load calculations do not include heat
gains to the space, since peak losses typically occur during the night
(unoccupied hours for most nonresidential buildings). When appro-
priate, heating credit may be taken for a portion of lighting, occu-
pancy, and equipment gains—but not for solar gains (passive-solar-
heated buildings are an exception to this general rule).
Development of a comprehensive building energy analysis
requires the HVAC&R designer to consider the many loads, other
than just the design load, that occur throughout a typical year in the
life of a building. This type of analysis requires year-long hourly
weather data (rather than just design conditions) and substantial com-
putation to calculate loads at off-peak conditions and the resulting
response of equipment to such loads. Although there are some man-
ual methods that allow an approximation, accurate energy analyses
require fairly sophisticated computer simulation capabilities. There
are numerous software programs that can provide such analyses, but
these are often specialized programs with steep learning curves.
4.2 DEFINITIONS
The following terms are commonly used to describe aspects of
heating and cooling loads.
block load: the diversified load that is used to size the HVAC&R
systems. It is based upon the consideration that not all perimeter
zones in a building peak at the same time. It is the maximum load
that equipment (an air handler, chiller, pump, fan) actually sees. It is
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐65
sometimes called the refrigeration load and is less than the sum of
the peak loads.
coincident load: a load that occurs at the same time as another load,
such as a latent load that is coincident with a sensible load or a solar
load that occurs at the same time as an occupancy load.
design load: a load that represents the highest reasonable heating or
cooling load likely to be experienced by a building (or zone) based
upon statistically significant climatic data. Design load is not the
highest load that may or can occur, but, rather, the highest load it is
reasonable to design for considering first cost of equipment and
energy-efficient operations.
diversified load: the portion of the sum of the peak loads that is
coincident. Load diversity accounts for the fact that the peak loads
in different building zones often do not occur simultaneously.
Therefore, the actual building peak load is generally smaller than
the undiversified sum of the zone peak loads. In a similar context,
this term is also used to describe loads resulting from equipment/
appliances that do not operate at full load at all times. Accurate
cooling load estimates must reasonably account for such diversified
operation patterns—particularly in spaces (such as kitchens or labs)
where equipment loads are an especially important concern.
dynamic load: a load that varies in intensity over time; it is usually
incremented in small time steps, such as seconds or minutes.
instantaneous load: a load that occurs during a defined time step/
period, usually one hour.
peak load: the largest load occurring in a space, a zone, or an entire
building. In the building load context, it is the maximum simulta-
neous or coincident load.
4.3 OUTDOOR AND INDOOR DESIGN CONDITIONS
Before performing heating and cooling load calculations, the
designer must establish appropriate outdoor and indoor design con-
ditions. Outdoor conditions can be obtained from the “Climatic
Design Information” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Funda-
mentals (and an accompanying CD). Design conditions specified by
Standard 90.1 are the 99.6% and 1% values for heating and cooling,
respectively. For special projects or spaces where precise control of
indoor temperature and humidity is required, other design values
may be more appropriate.
66⏐ LOAD CALCULATIONS
Indoor design conditions are governed either by thermal com-
fort conditions or by special requirements for materials or processes
housed in a space. In most buildings, such as offices and residences,
thermal comfort is the only requirement, and small fluctuations in
both temperature and humidity within the comfort zone are not
objectionable, as suggested in Figure 3-1. In other occupancies,
however, more precise control of temperature and humidity may be
required; refer to the appropriate chapter in the ASHRAE Hand-
book—HVAC Applications for recommendations. Standard 55 pro-
vides guidance on appropriate winter and summer indoor design
conditions. State or local energy codes and particular owner
requirements may also affect the establishment of criteria for indoor
design conditions.
4.4 EXTERNAL LOADS
External loads are highly variable, both by season and by time
of day. They cause significant changes in the heating and cooling
requirements over time, not only in the perimeter building spaces,
but for the total building heating/cooling plant.
4.4.1 Conduction through the Building Envelope
Most new buildings are well insulated, and conduction loads
through opaque wall and roof elements are generally small com-
pared to those through windows and skylights. Improved glazing
products, however, are steadily enhancing the performance of trans-
parent and translucent envelope components. Useful performance
data for fenestration products are readily available, much now certi-
fied by independent third-party organizations.
4.4.2 Solar Heat Gain through Glazing
Solar radiation often represents a major cooling load and is
highly variable with time and orientation. Careful analysis of heat
gains through windows, skylights, and glazed doors is imperative.
Facade self-shadowing, adjacent building shadowing, and reflec-
tions from the ground, water, snow, and parking areas must be con-
sidered in the loads analysis. Spaces with extensively glazed areas
must be analyzed for occupant comfort relative to radiant condi-
tions. Supply air for cooling must enter such spaces in a manner
that will offset the potential for warm glass surfaces or otherwise
provide adequate cooling to offset mean radiant temperature
effects. Exterior or interior shading devices to keep direct solar
radiation from falling on occupants should be considered. Close
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐67
coordination between the architect and HVAC engineer is critical in
buildings with extensive glazing.
4.4.3 Ventilation Load
The outdoor air ventilation load does not have a direct impact
on the conditioned space (except when provided via open win-
dows), but it does impose a load on the HVAC&R equipment.
Outdoor air is normally introduced through the HVAC system and
adds a load (sensible and latent) to the heating and cooling coils,
thus affecting their sizing and selection. The amount of ventilation
depends upon the occupancy and function of each space. Refer to
Standards 62.1 and 62.2 for recommended ventilation rates; see
also the requirements of the local building, mechanical, and
energy codes.
4.4.4 Infiltration Load
Most commercial and institutional buildings have inoperable
windows and are pressurized by the HVAC system to reduce the
infiltration (unintended flow) of outdoor air. It is generally assumed
that a pressurized building prevents infiltration, although infiltration
will often occur in the lower third of a building taller than 80 ft
[25 m] with an operating HVAC system and can occur throughout a
building when the HVAC system is shut off. The design heating load
(including infiltration) often occurs in the early morning hours (2:00
to 3:00 a.m.) when buildings are not occupied or pressurized. Gen-
eral building infiltration for larger buildings can be calculated by the
crack method. In entrance lobbies, determine the infiltration rate
based upon door-opening rates and pressure differentials due to
wind, temperature, and stack effect. See the “Infiltration and Ventila-
tion” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals for details
on estimating infiltration. In cold climates, infiltration loads can be
substantial. In hot, humid climates, sensible infiltration loads are
lower in magnitude, but latent infiltration loads can be substantial.
4.5 INTERNAL LOADS
While external loads can be heat gains or heat losses, internal
loads are always heat gains.
4.5.1 Heat Gains from Occupants,
Lighting, and Equipment
Heat gains from people are activity related: athletes in a gym-
nasium release eight times the amount of heat released by a seated
68⏐ LOAD CALCULATIONS
audience (see the “Physiological Principles, Comfort, and Health”
chapter and the “Air-Conditioning Cooling Load” chapter in the
ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals). The number of people in a
space may be estimated from seat counts, owner estimates, data in
ASHRAE publications, and the design engineer’s experience. Judg-
ment will always be required; for example, how many people might
be crowded around the dice tables in a gambling casino?
Heat gains from lights, people, and equipment (e.g., comput-
ers, copy machines, and process equipment) must be determined.
Illumination level and lamp/fixture type are usually determined by
the electrical engineer. The HVAC&R engineer must determine the
amount of heat gain (and its distribution among space and equip-
ment loads) for each space. For example, the radiant and convective
heat losses from lighting fixtures must be quantified to determine
how much heat can be captured by or near the fixture for return to
the air-handling unit and how much is added to the space load to be
handled by the room supply air.
Heat gains from equipment in offices can be estimated from
allowances expressed on a per square foot (square meter) basis, but
in other occupancies, estimating these gains is more complex. For
example, in central computer rooms, research laboratories, and pro-
cessing plants, the heat released from equipment creates most of the
cooling load. In a complex laboratory or manufacturing facility, it is
important to understand the operation of each piece of equipment,
its connected load, sensible and latent heat release to the space, and
the length of its operating cycle. For example, an electric oven will
use maximum power only during start-up periods; once it reaches
its set temperature, it will use only whatever power is required to
make up for heat lost to its surroundings. Therefore, the heat gain to
the space is the heat loss from the oven, not the connected load or
the power required during start-up. If several pieces of equipment
are located in one zone, the designer must determine the diversity of
use (i.e., how many units will be operating at the same time). With
assistance from the client and operating personnel (or from experi-
ence), the designer can develop a schedule of use to estimate the
maximum heat gain likely to impact the zone. Miscellaneous loads
in special occupancies should not be ignored, such as space cooling
benefits from open freezers in markets or heat and humidity gains
from indoor swimming pools and water features.
4.5.2 Heat Gains from Fans and Pumps
Supply and return air fans add heat to their circulated airstreams,
with the magnitude of heat depending upon static pressure and fan/
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐69
motor efficiencies. If the motor is located in the airstream along with
the fan, the heat released due to motor inefficiency must be included
in the load calculations. This is the quantity qsf in Figure 6-1 (Chap-
ter 6). If the motor is outside the airstream, then the inefficiency load
heats the space containing the motor. In either case, the motor heat
must be included in the cooling load calculations.
In I-P units:
fan bhp = (0.000157) (cfm) (TP) / (efficiency)
(4-1)
where
bhp = brake horsepower
cfm = airflow rate
TP
= total pressure, in. wg
Δt = (heat input, Btuh) / (1.1) (cfm)
(4-2)
= (fan bhp) (2545 Btu/hp) / (1.1) (cfm)
= (0.000157) (cfm) (TP) (2545) / (1.1) (cfm) (efficiency)
= (0.000157) (2545) (TP) / (1.1) (efficiency)
= (0.363) (TP) / (efficiency)
where
efficiency = (motor efficiency) (fan efficiency) (drive efficiency)
In SI units:
fan kW = (0.000997) (L/s) (TP) / (efficiency)
(4-3)
where
L/s = airflow rate
TP
= total pressure, kPa
Δt = (heat input) / (1.2) (L/s)
(4-4)
= (fan W) / (1.2) (L/s)
= (0.000997) (L/s) (TP) / (1.2) (L/s) (efficiency)
= (0.000997) (TP) / (1.2) (efficiency)
= (0.000831) (TP) / (efficiency)
where
efficiency = (motor efficiency) (fan efficiency) (drive efficiency)
This heat gain is approximately equal to 0.7°F per inch of water
static pressure [1.6°C per kPa]. When the motor is mounted outside
the airstream, only the fan efficiency affects airstream heat gain,
which is approximately 10%–15% less than fan and motor gain.
70⏐ LOAD CALCULATIONS
The only portion of fan energy that is not converted to a rise
in air temperature is the velocity pressure, which is the energy
required to increase the air velocity at the fan. The heat of fric-
tion related to the gradual pressure drop in a duct system causes
no temperature rise along the duct because this heat is equal to
and nullified by the expansion cooling effect of the static air
pressure reduction.
If the supply fan blows air through the cooling coil, all fan
energy heat (except that from velocity pressure) is absorbed in the
coil and does not affect the supply air load to the zones. With a draw-
through coil arrangement, however, the supply air capacity must be
increased (or the supply air temperature lowered) to make up for the
fan heat gain that occurs downstream of the cooling coil. In either
arrangement, the fan heat increases the equipment cooling load.
In all-water and air-and-water systems, the heat added by the
water circulating pumps must be included in the chilled-water load;
this can be assumed to be approximately 1.5% of the building load,
or can be calculated as follows:
heat added in Btu/h = (pump bhp) (2545 Btu/hp) … per hour (4-5)
[heat added in W = pump W]
Δt °F = (Btu/h) / (500) (gpm)
(4-6)
[Δt °C = (W) / (4177) (L/s)]
where
gpm = gallons per minute flow rate (L/s = liters per second flow rate)
4.5.3 Duct Losses
The “Duct Design” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fun-
damentals describes methods for calculating ductwork losses,
which are generally equal to 3% of total system air volume. Greater
leakage may occur, however, and could affect the design calcula-
tions (see the quantity qsd in Figure 6-1, Chapter 6). It is customary
to specify leakage testing for high-pressure duct systems but not for
low-pressure systems. Leakage in untaped low-pressure duct sys-
tems can run from 10% to 20% of total air volume. Low-pressure
connections to some diffusers can leak as much as 35% of terminal
air volume unless taped and sealed. Duct leakage does not affect
overall system loads unless it occurs within unconditioned spaces,
but it always affects supply air quantities and can affect system con-
trollability if excessive. Leakage through zone control dampers
affects supply air quantities for multi-zone and dual-duct systems,
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐71
as explained in Chapter 6. Suitable rules for duct design are given in
Section 5.8.
4.6 CALCULATION METHODS
Numerous heating and cooling load calculation procedures are
available to the designer. Most of the procedures are based upon
ASHRAE research and publications, with simplifications and
adjustments sometimes incorporated for specific applications.
Loads for small envelope-load-dominated buildings are often man-
ually calculated using a single design-day peak hour with the addi-
tion of a safety factor when selecting equipment. Loads for large,
multizoned buildings are almost universally calculated using com-
puter programs.
HVAC&R designers should not accept the results of computer
calculations without review and analysis. Until the 1960s, all
HVAC load calculations were performed manually. A good under-
standing of building behavior was gained through repeated itera-
tions of manual calculations. Computers have greatly shortened
calculation time, permit the use of more complex analytical tech-
niques, and help to structure load analyses. Nevertheless, it is
important to review and understand load calculation methods
before relying upon computer analyses. This involves understand-
ing the variables that go into load calculations, the effects of such
variables on loads, and the interactions between variables. Design-
ers should carefully review computer program documentation to
determine which calculation procedures are used. It is valuable to
compare computer results with approximate manual calculations
and to conduct sample load validations to confirm that the program
being used delivers what it claims. Software vendors do not accept
responsibility for the correctness of calculations or the use of a par-
ticular program—such responsibility lies in the hands of the
HVAC&R designer.
It is hard to generalize about computer load and energy analy-
sis software as there are so many variations available. Simpler pro-
grams tend to use automated implementations of manual
methodologies and a limited set of weather data. More complex
programs use calculation methodologies that are not amenable to
manual solution and a full 8760 annual hours of weather data.
Energy simulations typically address envelope, equipment, and sys-
tem performance parameters and their interactions. Be sure to
understand exactly what load/energy software that is being pro-
posed for use does—and how it does it. For a sense of the range of
72⏐ LOAD CALCULATIONS
software that is currently available, see the Building Energy Soft-
ware Tools Directory (DOE 2005).
The largest cooling loads in most commercial/institutional
buildings are due to solar radiation through glazing and internal
loads. In many special-purpose buildings (factories, shopping malls,
etc.), internal loads predominate. Inputs affecting these key loads
must therefore be developed with care. They include window and
skylight sizes, properties of glazing assemblies, interior and exterior
shading devices, lighting loads and controls, sensible and latent
loads due to people and equipment, and various operating schedules.
Some loads programs completely ignore exterior facade shadowing,
most simulate overhangs and side fins, but only a few account for
shadowing from adjacent buildings. Bear in mind that connected
electrical loads are not hourly demand loads, most individual equip-
ment does not operate at full load during a building’s operating
hours, and multiple equipment items often exhibit diversity.
4.7 COMPUTER INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
The accuracy of computer program output depends upon the
user’s inputs and the program’s calculation procedures. The inputs
include not only the typical architectural parameters of surface
areas and building material and assembly properties and indoor
design conditions but also ventilation airflow requirements, internal
loads, and their schedules of use.
4.7.1 Computer Inputs
All computer programs require input to perform the neces-
sary calculations; some inputs are mandatory, others may be
optional. If a user does not provide data for optional inputs,
built-in program default values are generally used. The designer
must understand and accept the appropriateness of the default val-
ues or override them by the input of more appropriate values.
Most load programs require user inputs of the basic properties of
construction types. When a proposed construction is not defined
in the “Air-Conditioning Cooling Load” chapter in the ASHRAE
Handbook—Fundamentals (or another publication), you may
need to use data from a similar type of construction or develop the
required input data by hand or by computer. For this purpose, you
may use component properties listed in the “Thermal and Vapor
Transmission Data” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Funda-
mentals or in other publications. Typically, the thermal properties
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐73
of most assemblies (except prefab components) must be calcu-
lated from fundamental material properties.
Most load programs allow input of internal loads on a unit
floor area basis. If the load is specified on a unit area basis, the pro-
gram will use the zone area to calculate the load. Be sure to enter
building-specific use schedules for people, lighting, and equipment
so that appropriate load diversity is included in the HVAC system
and central plant calculations. Remember that design use schedules
are not the same as average use schedules. Design schedules are
used to determine peak cooling loads in each space, while average
schedules are used for energy calculations. If actual use schedules
are not available, they must be estimated. One approach is to
assume a constant load profile and add an experience-derived diver-
sity factor to the system and the central plant load calculations.
Energy calculations, unlike load calculations, are significantly
affected by equipment control schedules.
Many programs use the air change method to calculate infiltra-
tion loads. Given the number of air changes per hour as input, the
program multiplies this value by the input zone area and height. In
specifying zone height, distinguish between the floor-to-ceiling
height and the building’s floor-to-floor height. The zone height
must correspond to the air change rate for the same height. Most
programs allow the user to specify the ventilation load in cubic feet
per minute (cfm) [liters per second (L/s)], cfm per square foot [L/s
per square meter], or cfm per person [L/s per person]. You may also
usually input the zone exhaust in cfm. Load programs typically
compare the ventilation rate with the exhaust rate and select the
larger of the two as the outdoor air requirement.
Select the HVAC system and zones that will be served by that
system. For each system, input the maximum and minimum supply
air temperatures or the cfm [L/s] to be supplied to each zone. If sup-
ply air temperatures are input, most programs will determine the
zone cfm [L/s] based upon the calculated zone sensible heat. After
the supply and outdoor air quantities have been determined, most
programs will also calculate the fan heat and perform the necessary
psychrometric analyses.
4.7.2 Computer Outputs
All comprehensive computer load programs provide a sum-
mary of peak sensible and latent cooling loads and sensible heating
loads for each thermal zone. The cooling load should be itemized
by roof conduction, wall conduction, floor conduction, glass con-
74⏐ LOAD CALCULATIONS
duction, glass solar transmission, people, lights, equipment, and
infiltration. The time and date when the peak cooling loads occur
are usually given, and some programs also indicate the outdoor con-
ditions at the time of the peak load. Most programs also provide
psychrometric data for each HVAC system, including state points
for room air dry-bulb temperature and humidity, outdoor and sup-
ply airflow rates, outdoor and mixed-air dry- and wet-bulb tempera-
tures, and cooling coil entering and leaving conditions. These data
are necessary for the final selection of heating and cooling coils.
Do not assume that computer output is correct simply
because it is given to decimal-place accuracy. There is usually
substantial room for input errors, and there can also be glitches in
the computer program itself. Output should be studied in detail to
determine its correctness, and any inconsistencies must be
resolved. It is important to check some of the outputs with hand
calculations and review summary results (such as Btuh/ft2 [W/m2]
and cfm/ft2 [L/s m2]) for reasonableness. Apply a common sense
test to results. Investigate all anomalies to determine if they repre-
sent errors or simply quirks in building response. Also, realize
that additional psychrometric analysis is required to establish a
final HVAC system design in most situations.
4.7.3 Computer Programs
Design-day heating and cooling loads are required to (1) deter-
mine peak hour sensible and latent heat loads in each thermal zone,
(2) establish supply air quantities, (3) select cooling and heating
coils, and (4) obtain building diversified loads (also called block
loads) for sizing of equipment. To determine the zone peak loads,
perform calculations for each hour of the year to be sure that each
thermal zone is exposed to the greatest impact due to the weather
(temperature, humidity, solar) and internal loads (people, lights,
equipment). Coincident zone loads add up to the diversified load
imposed upon the central heating and cooling equipment.
Most design offices routinely use personal-computer-based
programs that calculate design-day heating and cooling loads. Such
programs are an important production tool and, to be viable, must
have the capacity to handle a large number of thermal zones. Other
multiparameter calculations, such as the sizing of duct and piping
networks and the analysis of sprinkler loops, can also be handled by
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐75
available computer programs. On the other hand, comprehensive
energy calculation programs are used primarily for energy code
compliance and, in most offices, are only infrequently used for
comparative energy studies.
Remember that internal load schedules for peak-load calcula-
tions are not the same as those used in annual energy simulations.
Energy calculations require average use schedules, while peak-load
calculations require design load schedules to be certain that the
HVAC&R system will meet all the design-day space loads. A typi-
cal office building load schedule is shown in Table 4-1.

4.8 EFFECTS OF ALTITUDE
Standard psychrometric charts and performance data published
by manufacturers generally assume equipment operation at sea
level. When a project is located at a significantly higher altitude,
allowances must be made. Factors by which the usual (sea level)
data must be multiplied when operating at higher altitudes are sum-
marized in Table 4-2. For items not listed, consult appropriate
sources, such as the Engineering Guide for Altitude Effects (Car-
rier) or contact equipment manufacturers.

5.1 CONTEXT
The components of an air-conditioning system fall into four
broad categories: source, distribution, delivery, and control ele-
ments. Source components provide primary heating and cooling
effect and include chillers, boilers, cooling towers, and similar
equipment. Distribution components transport heating or cooling
effect from the source(s) to the spaces that require conditioning and
include ductwork, fans, piping, and pumps. Delivery components
introduce heating or cooling effect into conditioned spaces and
include diffusers, baseboard radiators, fan-coil units, and a range of
other “terminal” devices. Control components regulate the opera-
tion of equipment and systems for comfort, process, safety, and
energy efficiency. In central systems these components may be
spread throughout a building. In local systems these components
are all packaged into a relatively small container.
The many components of air-conditioning systems are pre-
sented in depth in several chapters in the ASHRAE Handbook—
HVAC Systems and Equipment. That resource should be a primary
reference because this design manual covers only a few items of
particular importance to HVAC&R system design. This chapter
provides an overview of key components; subsequent chapters dis-
cuss the arrangements of components that constitute various
HVAC&R system configurations.
5.2 COOLING SOURCE EQUIPMENT
5.2.1 Vapor-Compression Refrigeration
The most commonly used source of building cooling is the
vapor-compression refrigeration thermodynamic cycle. For small
capacities, reciprocating, rotary, or scroll compressors are used;
CHAPTER 5
COMPONENTS
80⏐ COMPONENTS
medium-sized units frequently employ screw compressors; large
units use centrifugal compressors. Reciprocating compressors for
air-conditioning applications consume approximately 1 kW/ton
[0.3 kW/kW], while centrifugal units can consume as little as
0.52 kW/ton [0.16 kW/kW].
A vapor-compression system for building cooling usually con-
sists of one or more components that either directly cool air (termed
“DX” for direct expansion) or cool water (using a chiller). Cooled
air from a DX system is conducted to conditioned spaces; chilled
water from a chiller is conducted to cooling coils where it subse-
quently cools air. Each refrigeration device includes a refrigerant
compressor driven by a prime mover (usually an electric motor).
The compressor takes its suction from a heat exchanger (the evapo-
rator) and discharges refrigerant into a second heat exchanger (the
condenser). Condensed (liquid) refrigerant passes from the con-
denser to the evaporator through a throttling valve, thus providing a
closed refrigerant circuit.
A refrigeration system works against thermal lift, the differ-
ence between the condensing temperature and the evaporating tem-
perature. Typical chiller condenser water temperatures are 85°F
[29.4°C] supply and 95°F [35.0°C] return. Typical chilled-water
temperatures are 44°F [6.7°C] supply and 56°F [13.3°C] return.
Raising the chilled-water temperature 1°F [0.6°C] can reduce the
energy used for refrigeration by approximately 1.75%. Changing
the temperature range (difference between supply and return) of
either the condenser-water loop or the chilled-water loop will
impact the flow requirements for those systems—with reduced
pumping horsepower for higher temperature ranges. The advan-
tages of using ultralow chilled-water temperatures are discussed in
Section 9.3.8.
Split systems are DX systems in which the evaporator and con-
denser are separated and placed at different locations. (As a rule,
the compressor is located near the condenser.) The upper practical
limit for total distance between the evaporator and condenser is
300 ft [90 m], but the only true limit is based upon careful design of
the interconnecting refrigerant piping. The compressor discharge
line should be sized for a gas velocity of no less than 1000 fpm
[5 m/s] under minimum load with upward gas flow and no less than
500 fpm [2.5 m/s] with horizontal flow. The maximum recom-
mended flow velocity under full load is 4000 fpm [20 m/s] because
higher velocities generally cause excessive pressure drop and noise.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐81
Packaged (predesigned) split systems are typically restricted to sub-
stantially shorter separation distances.
The upper limit for vertical lift (difference in elevation) is
60 ft [18 m]. When the net lift is no more than 8 ft [2.4 m], no
U-traps are required to ensure return of oil to the compressor (Fig-
ure 5-1). However, in these cases, the pipe must pitch away from
the compressor at least 0.5 in. for every 10 ft [4.2 mm per m] of
horizontal run. Suction and hot gas risers that exceed 8 ft [2.4 m]
of net lift require a trap at the base of the riser and an additional
trap at each 25 ft [7.6 m] interval of net lift (Figure 5-2). If the
compressor is installed below the condenser, the hot gas discharge
must have double risers to capture the oil in a P-trap and lift it to
the condenser for eventual return to the compressor. In this case,
always use an oil separator directly after the compressor discharge
valve and an inverted P-trap entering the condenser with a liquid
shutoff valve leaving the condenser. A P-trap consists of three
line-size elbows arranged to trap oil in two of the elbows before
the horizontal run. A smaller diameter bypass permits gas to con-
tinue flowing until sufficient pressure is built up to propel the
trapped oil upward to the condenser.
It is wise to include a receiver between the condenser and the
evaporator. This is a horizontal tank that allows separation of refrig-
erant gas and liquid; the receiver serves as a reservoir for the refrig-
erant and accommodates changes in inventory in the refrigerant
loop under different operating conditions. Alternatively, it may be
possible to hold refrigerant in the condenser.
Figure 5-1. Refrigerant line arrangement for low lift.
82⏐ COMPONENTS
Receivers, when used, should be designed to store the entire
refrigerant charge (to handle winter shutdown or when high-side
components are removed for repair). This avoids the need to vent
refrigerant, an unacceptable practice because of its expense and
harmful effect on the ozone layer. Receivers should be sized to be
no more than 80% full, allowing 20% for expansion.
The International Building Code (ICC 2003) specifies minimum
ventilation requirements for dilution of lost refrigerant in a compres-
sor room. The code also prescribes proper sizing for mechanical
room exhaust fans and limitations on the auxiliary equipment that
may be installed in a mechanical room. Follow local codes if they are
more restrictive than model codes. “Break-glass stations” must be
provided at each exit door, to start the exhaust fan and shut down the
refrigeration equipment in case of an emergency. Be sure to provide
for sufficient makeup air, which need not be conditioned.
Refrigerants R-11, R-12, R-113, R-114, and R-115 have histor-
ically been used in building applications, depending upon system
capacity. These refrigerants, however, are being phased out of use
(and are no longer manufactured in the United States) in accordance
with the Montreal Protocol. This international treaty, signed in 1987
and ratified since then by most industrial nations, including the
United States and Canada, aims to reduce the use of chlorofluoro-
carbons (CFCs) in order to protect the ozone layer of the strato-
sphere. Note that ozone protection is not identical to concerns about
global warming, although both issues involve the release of gases
Figure 5-2. Refrigerant line arrangement for high lift.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐83
into the atmosphere. Alternative refrigerants include R-22 for small
or medium-sized systems, R-123 to replace R-11, and R-134a to
replace R-12. Refrigerant properties are seen as an element of green
design, and alternative refrigerants are promoted as such by equip-
ment manufacturers.
5.2.2 Absorption Refrigeration
The absorption refrigeration cycle is primarily employed in large
capacity applications where a motive force other than electricity (such
as steam or suitable waste process heat) is readily available. Often the
initial costs of an absorption versus a vapor-compression refrigeration
system are within 15% to 20% of each other, the compression cycle
being less expensive (except where subsidies or incentives for absorp-
tion systems are available). The coefficient of performance (COP) of
an absorption-refrigeration system will be less than that of a vapor-
compression system—COPs for absorption systems are typically less
than 1.0. Due to the greater heat rejection of absorption systems (gen-
erally 31,000 Btu/ton [2.6 kW/kW]) compared to compression sys-
tems (15,000 Btu/ton or less [1.25 kW/kW]), cooling towers,
condenser-water pumps, and other auxiliaries must be larger and are
therefore more expensive for absorption systems than for compression
systems.
Absorption machines can be direct-fired (when a heat source is
directly applied to the machine) or indirect-fired by steam or hot
water generated by gas or oil combustion or another process (such
as solar energy or waste heat). Absorption machines also require a
few electric auxiliaries. An economic comparison of refrigeration
systems depends greatly upon relative energy costs. Since most
air-conditioning ton-hours occur in the summer months and gas
utilities may have more economical rates during summer, absorp-
tion chillers may be economically attractive under those conditions
(although recent energy demands have broken down many tradi-
tional usage and economic patterns). Absorption machines do not
use any CFCs, which has seen them promoted as a green alternative
to mechanical refrigeration. Absorption chillers can also be quieter
than vapor-compression machines and produce less vibration.
5.2.3 Evaporative Cooling
The use of evaporative coolers to provide direct active cooling
has decreased since the 1950s, when an emphasis on low first cost
overwhelmed consideration of operating or life-cycle costs and
tended to relegate evaporative coolers to niche markets. This situa-
84⏐ COMPONENTS
tion persists today. Depending upon a building’s operating hours and
location, however, evaporative cooling can be applied effectively
from both a cost and performance perspective. This is certainly true
in the southwestern United States, where low outdoor wet-bulb tem-
peratures are prevalent, in other locations where wet-bulb tempera-
tures are below 55°F to 60°F [12.8°C to 15.6°C] for a substantial
number of hours, or when a building is to be air conditioned at night
and there is a fairly wide diurnal temperature swing.
Direct evaporative cooling requires 100% outdoor air and
exhaust capability; therefore, the cost of equipment space, filter
capacity, air delivery, etc., must be weighed against the energy sav-
ings of evaporative cooling versus refrigeration cooling. Indirect
evaporative cooling broadens the application range of this psychro-
metric process into climate zones and occupancies where direct
evaporative cooling is not a viable system choice.
Two general types of evaporative cooling equipment are avail-
able: spray-type air washers and wetted-media-type coolers. These
options are discussed below.
5.2.3.1 Spray-Type Air Washers. Spray-type air washers are
versatile in that they can use chilled water from a refrigeration sys-
tem when the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature is high, but they can
also provide cooling without chilled water when the outdoor air is
suitable for conventional evaporative cooling.
Two types of spray air washers are available. One type is the
“full open” spray washer. It is generally either 7 or 11 ft [2.1 or
3.4 m] long in the direction of airflow, depending upon whether it
has one or more spray banks. Air passes through the device at about
500 fpm [2.5 m/s] and passes through a spray of water. The direct
contact of air with the water droplets provides an efficient heat
exchange. Depending upon air velocity and spray density (gpm/ft2
[L/s m2]), the adiabatic efficiency (the ratio of actual dry-bulb
depression to the difference between entering air dry-bulb and
spray water temperature) can be as high as 98%.
Another type of air washer is the “short-coil” washer. It con-
sists of a conventional extended finned coil bank placed in a cas-
ing with a deep water pan and an opposing spray bank. The short-
coil washer has a much lower spray density than the spray washer
and only requires 4 ft [1.2 m] of length in the direction of airflow.
When the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature is not conducive to
evaporative cooling, chilled-water coils provide cooling. When
the outdoor air wet-bulb temperature is sufficiently low, the
chilled-water coils are shut off and a spray of water cascading
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐85
over the extended coil fins provides the cooling effect. The closed
circuit chilled-water loop of the short-coil washer requires less
chilled-water pumping energy than a full-open device. Because of
lower spray capacity than the full-open approach, however, it has
an adiabatic efficiency of only 50%, thereby requiring more hours
of active refrigeration operation.
Water reservoirs require constant maintenance to prevent cor-
rosion and the buildup of bacteria and fungi that would otherwise
be dispersed into the airstream during the evaporative cooling pro-
cess. When this is not done, air washers can become a potential
source of biological contaminants and a cause of poor indoor air
quality and/or sick building syndrome.
5.2.3.2 Wetted-Media-Type Coolers. Because wetted-media
coolers use nonrefrigerated water, they are adaptable to air-condi-
tioning systems only in those climate zones where very low ambi-
ent wet-bulb temperatures prevail year-round. In a climate such as
that of Phoenix, Arizona, a dual air-conditioning system may be
indicated under certain conditions—wetted media for ten months
of the year and compression refrigeration during the two-month
humid season. The extremely low operating cost of the wetted-
media evaporative cooler often justifies the higher initial invest-
ment for two systems.
The systems described thus far are direct evaporative coolers
because water is injected into the primary (supply) airstream, which
is cooled adiabatically. In indirect evaporative coolers, secondary
air (outdoor air or exhaust air) on one side of a heat exchanger is
cooled evaporatively. The primary (supply) air is on the other side
of the heat exchanger and is indirectly cooled through the heat
exchanger walls; thus, no moisture is added to the primary air,
although it is sensibly cooled. The leaving dry-bulb temperature of
the primary air can be no lower than the entering wet-bulb tempera-
ture of the secondary air. An indirect evaporative cooler used as a
precooler is illustrated in Figure 5-3. Other examples are given in
the “Evaporative Air Cooling” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—
HVAC Systems and Equipment. That chapter also covers technolog-
ical improvements to the evaporative cooling process, which
broaden the scope of application through the use of two-stage (and
even three-stage) indirect/direct evaporative cooling.
5.2.4 Desiccant Systems
Desiccant systems dry air by exposure to desiccants. A desic-
cant is a liquid or solid that has a high affinity for water—a hygro-
86⏐ COMPONENTS
scopic substance. Desiccants are regenerated (dried after absorbing
water) by heating. Such systems, used where latent loads are a seri-
ous design issue, are discussed in Section 9.1.
5.2.5 Prime Movers
Induction electric motors are the predominant prime mover for
refrigeration compressors. Where local electric utility rates incor-
porate a penalty for low power factor, the addition of capacitors or
the use of synchronous electric motors to improve power factor may
be cost-effective.
Where natural gas is relatively cheap (seasonally or throughout
the year), a combination of gas- or steam-turbine-driven centrifugal
compression and absorption refrigeration is sometimes used, partic-
ularly for large buildings. This scheme is referred to as a piggyback
system, in which steam is generated in a boiler and first sent to a
back-pressure turbine, which drives a centrifugal compressor. The
exhaust from the steam turbine becomes the thermal input to an
absorption chiller. When a gas turbine drives the compressor, its
exhaust gases generate steam for the absorption unit in a heat recov-
ery boiler. As a general rule, the steam-turbine-driven compressor is
selected to have one-half the capacity of the absorption unit.
Example 5.1. For a total air-conditioning load of 900 tons
[3165 kW], select a 300 ton [1055 kW] centrifugal chiller driven by a
back-pressure turbine with a steam rate of 36 lb/hp [21.9 kg/kW];
Figure 5-3. Indirect evaporative cooler used as a precooler.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐87
couple this with a single-effect, low-pressure, 600 ton [2110 kW]
absorption chiller having a steam rate of 18 lb/ton [2.4 kg/kW]. The
result is 900 tons [3165 kW] of capacity using 10,800 lb [4900 kg] of
steam per hour or 12 lb/ton [1.6 kg/kW]. This compares with 18 lb/
ton [2.4 kg/kW] for a single-effect absorption system.
Where district steam is available in the summer at low cost,
steam-driven turbines are sometimes used as prime movers for large
centrifugal chillers. Here again, the selection of steam versus elec-
tric drive depends primarily upon the relative utility costs, and a
careful analysis should be made to determine the relative merits of
the prime mover options. On rare occasions and for very large
buildings, gas turbines have been used as prime movers for centrif-
ugal compressors, either with or without waste heat boilers.
There is increasing interest in the use of combined heat and
power (CHP) systems (also called cogeneration systems) that pro-
duce electricity on site and provide a consistent source of “waste”
heat that can be used as a prime mover medium. See, for example, a
discussion of CHP systems for commercial buildings in the
ASHRAE Journal (Zogg et al. 2005).
5.2.6 Variable-Speed Drives
The use of variable-speed (variable-frequency) drives for com-
pressors, air handlers, and pumps has become common because
they are readily available at reasonable cost and can provide energy
savings in many system types. These drives are solid-state devices
that were, at one time, add-ons to constant speed drive equipment.
They are now frequently part of the factory-supplied equipment for
air handlers, pumps, and compressors. Variable-speed drives save
energy whenever electric motors run at less than full power. Since
most HVAC&R equipment rarely runs at full capacity, substantial
energy savings are available with these drives. Typical centrifugal
compressor performance curves under prerotation vane control and
under variable-speed control are shown in Figures 5-4 and 5-5,
respectively. Power demands of fans under different methods of
capacity control are compared in Figure 5-6. Another advantage of
variable-speed drives is that they provide high power factors,
thereby eliminating the need to provide power factor correction for
connected motors.
Comparing two methods of fan capacity control—inlet vane
and variable-speed—the following issues arise. When reducing
flow rate from full capacity, inlet vanes are initially efficient, but, as
they progressively close, the reduction in flow rate is attributable
88⏐ COMPONENTS
more to throttling than to imparting initial spin to the air entering
the impeller. Inlet vanes also impose about a 10% horsepower pen-
alty because they obstruct the fan inlet. Variable-speed control
maintains a high efficiency over the entire operating range and is
therefore more energy conserving (Figure 5-6).

tion vane control. (Courtesy of Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning 1984.)
Figure 5-5. Variable-speed compressor performance. (Courtesy of
Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning 1984.)
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐89
Variable-speed controls for centrifugal pumps have characteris-
tics similar to those shown in Figure 5-6. The system implications
of variable-speed pumping are discussed in Section 8.8. Additional
information is contained in the “Compressors,” “Condensers,” and
“Motors, Motor Controls, and Variable-Speed Drives” chapters in
the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Systems and Equipment.
Like all solid-state devices, variable-speed drives are sensitive to
differences in phase loads. Therefore, ensure that the phase differ-
ences are no greater than 10% on circuits incorporating such devices.
5.3 HEATING SOURCE EQUIPMENT
5.3.1 Boilers
Four principal types of boilers are commercially available to
designers of heating plants for large buildings:
Type
Fuel
Sectional cast iron
Oil, gas, or dual fuel
Water tube
Oil, gas, or dual fuel
Fire tube
Oil, gas, or dual fuel
Electric resistance
Electricity
Figure 5-6. Fan power versus volume characteristics for different con-
trol methods. (Courtesy of Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning 1984.)
90⏐ COMPONENTS
Oil, gas, and electricity are the energy sources most commonly
used in new buildings. On rare occasions, coal, wood chips or hog
fuel, biomass, or solid waste are used.
The principal reasons for selecting central boilers for heating
are (1) to provide a plant at a convenient central location that can
distribute a secondary heating medium (hot water or steam)
throughout a building or a multibuilding complex, (2) to take
advantage of the diversity of individual zone loads, and (3) to cen-
tralize maintenance. The choice of fuel should be made on the basis
of life-cycle cost, not on first cost alone. If the budget permits, in
areas where the gas utility provides a firm and interruptible gas rate,
consider dual-fuel burners (oil/propane or gas) when selecting com-
bustion boilers. Under normal conditions, the boilers would operate
on cheaper interruptible gas. When the utility curtails this supply
during periods of high demand, the operator would switch to the
standby fuel (oil or propane). If recommending dual-fuel burners,
inform the owner/operator of the importance of using the alternate
fuel occasionally each season to ensure fuel system readiness.
The following issues should be considered when selecting a
boiler type. Consider a sectional cast iron boiler if unskilled opera-
tors are anticipated. Cast iron is least susceptible to oxidation due to
poor water treatment. Its principal operational concern is thermal
shock. If heavy oil is the principal fuel, consider a fire tube boiler
because it is easier to clear the tubes of soot (by rodding them),
whereas a water tube boiler requires soot blowers in the exhaust gas
stream. Use of these devices, however, is restricted by many com-
munities. In choosing fuel burners, consider pressure-atomizing
burners up to 500,000 Btu/h [145 kW]. Above this capacity, investi-
gate air-atomizing, flame retention burners, which become favor-
able at 1 million Btu/h [295 kW] and above.
If electric boilers are considered, make a selection based upon
more than just low first cost. Electric resistance boilers vary in
cost, depending upon the power density of elements and the con-
trol steps; 50 W/in.2 is preferable to 100 W/in.2 [32 kW/mm2 vs.
64 kW/mm2], and a large number of control steps is also desirable.
Modular boilers are often a reasonable choice in large installations.
Care needs to be taken to match the boiler voltage to the available
building system voltage, as actual output capacity is dependent
upon operating voltage.
If a boiler plant is the heat source for a closed-loop heat pump
system, heat pump selection and water-loop temperature controls
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐91
are important. Excessive temperatures in the water loop can cause
operational problems with closed-loop heat pumps.
5.3.2 Furnaces
The purpose of a furnace is to directly heat air for space condi-
tioning. Furnaces are seldom selected as the heat source for large
buildings. They are often used, however, in small office buildings,
residences, and industrial plants (in modular form).
5.3.3 Electric Resistance Heating
Electric resistance may provide the heat source for a boiler or
furnace, as discussed above. Electric resistance heating is also often
used in conjunction with local or terminal heating systems. The
benefit of this particular application is the flexibility it offers in
locating small units (baseboard convectors, unit heaters, or terminal
duct heaters) in or near individual spaces as a means of zone con-
trol. In the case of in-duct heaters, flow sensors should be provided
to disconnect the heater element whenever airflow stops in order to
avoid a fire hazard.
Care must be exercised in selecting electric heaters (such as
baseboard radiators) because they have a fixed output based upon
their wattage. By comparison, hot water radiator output can be var-
ied by changing operating water temperature or flow rate to
increase capacity as necessary to deal with local load conditions.
While, at first glance, electric resistance heating may not
appear to be economical, a careful examination of local electric
utility rates can determine whether this impression is justified.
Many utilities have offered incentives to all-electric buildings and
rebates for thermal storage (Section 9.2) are frequently available.
Since electric resistance heating is often the lowest-first-cost alter-
native, this option deserves a careful economic analysis. A guide to
electric utility tariffs is given in Section 2.8.5.
5.3.4 Electric Heat Pumps
Heat pumps transfer heat extracted from one medium (air,
water) to another medium via the vapor-compression refrigeration
cycle. Options include air-source, water-source, ground-source, and
heat reclaim systems. Ground-source heat pumps are increasingly
being used in green buildings because of their high efficiency.
Another potential heat source for heat pumps is building exhaust air
after it has first been utilized in a heat exchanger coupled with out-
door air intakes.
92⏐ COMPONENTS
In large buildings, the perimeter-to-floor area ratio is relatively
small compared to that in small buildings. Consequently, internal
gains attributable to lights, computers, occupants, and other heat
sources are high compared to transmission losses. During unoccu-
pied periods, the building electrical capacity normally relegated to
serving lighting and plug loads is available for perimeter heating by
heat pumps supplemented with electric resistance heat.
Heat pumps need not meet 100% of the heating requirements
of a building. Frequently, it is more practical to select only those
areas easily served with heat pumps and to provide supplemental
loop or point-of-use heat from another medium (electric resistance,
gas) for areas such as entrance vestibules, etc. These and other heat
pump uses are described in the “Applied Heat Pump and Heat
Recovery Systems” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Sys-
tems and Equipment. Packaged terminal air conditioners, often
employed for cooling core areas of large buildings, and
water-source heat pumps, used in closed loops (see Chapter 7 of
this manual), are described in the same Handbook volume.
5.4 HEAT TRANSFER EQUIPMENT
5.4.1 Condensers and Evaporators
These types of heat exchangers are described in more detail in
the “Condensers” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Sys-
tems and Equipment. Only a few of the most important consider-
ations relating to system design are mentioned here.
Shell-and-tube condensers are the most prevalent type in large
building air-conditioning applications. These are generally avail-
able in one, two, three, or four passes on the water-tube side,
depending upon the flow of condenser water versus pressure drop.
Frequently, a designer can choose between two-pass and three-pass
or three-pass and four-pass with little difference in condenser per-
formance and, by doing so, can select a water piping arrangement
most suitable to the equipment room layout. Remember that large
buildings generally require large-diameter condenser-water pipes,
which are both expensive and occupy a large volume of space. As a
first cut, design heat exchangers with a 3°F to 5°F [1.7°C to 2.8°C]
approach temperature. Shell-and-tube condensers require periodic
cleaning of the inside of the tubes to maintain performance. There-
fore, on large condensers, consider marine-type water boxes. They
permit removal of condenser heads for tube cleaning without dis-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐93
mantling the condenser-water piping. Integral mechanical cleaning
systems are also an option.
In most urban atmospheres, condenser water circulated through
open cooling towers can cause rapid scale buildup on condenser
tubes. It is inconvenient to shut down cooling systems for mainte-
nance during the summer months, yet tube scale buildup peaks in late
summer just when full capacity is needed. Consequently, consider
specifying centrifugal chilling systems with a fouling factor of 0.001
rather than the typical commercial factor of 0.0005 because a 0.0005
fouling factor can be built up during the first weeks of the cooling
season. Chemical water treatment systems can also be specified.
Most manufacturers of centrifugal or absorption chillers offer
more than one condenser size. Due to competition, manufacturers
are inclined to focus on lowest first cost in their initial product offer.
Such equipment proposals often include a condenser that is margin-
ally acceptable. A condenser with limited condenser surface is apt
not to meet the equipment full-load capacity rating, which most
likely will be needed at the time the condenser tubes are most
fouled. Large shell-and-tube condensers are manufactured using
extruded finned tubes with nearly the same ratio of primary (tube)
and secondary (fin) surface. As a general rule, provide at least 6 ft2
of total external surface (primary plus secondary) per ton [0.16 m2
per kW] of full-load rating for conservative sizing of a condenser.
Added condenser surface will pay dividends in two ways: longer
tube-cleaning intervals (tube cleaning is labor intensive and there-
fore expensive) and lower condensing temperatures with associated
reduced energy use. Life-cycle costing must be considered when
specifying the size of evaporator and condenser surfaces.
In direct expansion systems, estimate about 1/15 hp per ton
[0.014 kW/kW] of refrigeration for the condenser fan. Raising the
evaporator temperature 1°F [0.6°C] decreases energy use by
approximately 1.75%. Lowering the condensing temperature 1°F
[0.6°C] produces approximately one-half of this saving.
Absorption systems are more sensitive to condenser tube foul-
ing than compression systems, and the designer should either
devote extra care to design for easy cleaning or allow for large foul-
ing factors during analysis of equipment performance. Many sys-
tems can be retrofitted with online tube-cleaning equipment for low
fouling factors. Some manufacturers offer such devices, which
maintain a low fouling factor through the entire operating period.
Sidestream sand filters have also performed well in cleaning con-
denser water.
94⏐ COMPONENTS
5.4.2 Double-Bundle Heat Exchangers
Double-bundle condensers are an option for large heat pump
and heat recovery systems. As the name implies, two water tube
bundles are contained in a single shell. High-pressure refrigerant
vapor discharged into the condenser shell from the compressor sur-
rounds—and is in contact with—both tube bundles. The condens-
ing temperature is based upon the number of active tubes. When a
double-bundle condenser provides hot water (100 to 110°F [37.8 to
43.3°C]) for low-density fin-type baseboard (or unit) heaters or for
hot water reheat coils, the water is circulated through the winter
bundle of the condenser where it picks up the heat rejected from the
condenser (see Figure 5-7). When the evaporator-compressor por-
tion of the system is called upon to provide more cooling than can
be absorbed by the hot water bundle, the summer bundle is acti-
vated by circulating cooling tower water, which permits the rejec-
tion of the excess heat through the cooling tower. Close control is
provided by bypassing a varied quantity of water around the cool-
ing tower as needed to sustain the temperature of the hot water leav-
ing the winter bundle.
Double-bundle evaporators are used only rarely. An example is
a double-bundle evaporator and a double-bundle condenser used
with a well-water heat pump, providing chilled water in summer
and hot water in winter. In summer, chilled water is circulated
through the summer bundle of the evaporator and well water is cir-
culated through the summer bundle of the condenser (to reject the
heat to the environment). Conversely, in winter, hot water is circu-
lated through the winter bundle of the condenser and the well water
Figure 5-7. Double-bundle condenser (Griffin 1974).
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐95
is circulated through the winter bundle of the evaporator (to absorb
heat from the well water).
Heat exchangers are often used in place of double-bundle con-
densers. This is less efficient, however, because it adds the penalty
of an additional temperature difference. In lieu of a double-bundle
condenser, an auxiliary condenser is added beside the main con-
denser to act as the winter bundle. With this arrangement, care
should be taken in piping the compressor discharge into the con-
denser so that the superheat is picked up by the lead condenser,
which should always be the winter bundle.
5.4.3 Plate Heat Exchangers
A plate-type heat exchanger can transfer heat from one liquid
to another at high efficiency (with a 2°F to 3°F [1.1°C to 1.7°C]
approach). This device consists of a series of gasketed, embossed
metal plates (usually stainless steel) held between two rigid end
frames by threaded rods and spanner nuts. The alternating plates
create a heat exchanger with a cold medium on one side and a warm
medium on the other side of the plate, allowing for counterflow in
very narrow passages. Heat transfer rates are very high due to the
large surface area that even a small plate heat exchanger provides
and due to turbulence created by embossing the plates with corruga-
tions, which forces the flow into a thin turbulent film that eliminates
stagnant areas. Pressure drops are comparable to those of
shell-and-tube heat exchangers because of the many parallel paths
in plate heat exchangers. When cleaning is required, the exchanger
is opened by unscrewing the spanner nuts and spreading the plates
to permit wash-down by a hose and brushing of plate surfaces if
needed. Some concerns have, however, been expressed about the
collection of debris in plate heat exchangers.
The use of various types of heat exchangers in air-conditioning
systems is increasing in a quest for improved energy efficiency,
including the following applications:
•
Cooling chilled water directly with cooling tower water in win-
ter or whenever the temperature of the tower water is less than
that of the chilled-water return (see Section 9.3.9).
•
Using heat exchangers in place of double-bundle condensers
(or double-bundle evaporators) in heat pump applications.
•
Using them in solar thermal collector systems or other applica-
tions requiring heat exchange between glycol and water.
96⏐ COMPONENTS
•
Using them for heat exchange between thermal storage systems
(hot or cold) and circulating hot-water or chilled-water streams.
•
The numerous opportunities for heat reclaim between various
flow streams in a typical building.
5.4.4 Cooling Coils
Cooling coils are used to exchange heat (sensible and latent)
between an airflow and water or refrigerant. Cooling coils are usu-
ally selected to perform within the following limits:
•
Entering air dry-bulb temperature: 65°F to 100°F [18.3°C to
37.8°C]
•
Entering air wet-bulb temperature: 60°F to 85°F [15.6°C to
29.4°C]
•
Air face velocity: 300 to 600 fpm [1.5 to 3.0 m/s]
•
Refrigerant saturation temperature at coil outlet: 30°F to 50°F
[–1.1°C to 10.0°C]
•
Refrigerant superheat at coil outlet: 6°F or more [3.3°C] to pre-
vent slugging the compressor with liquid
•
Refrigerant entering temperature: 35°F to 65°F [1.7°C to
18.3°C]
•
Chilled-water quantity: 1.2 to 2.4 gpm per ton [0.02 to 0.04 L/s
per kW], equivalent to a water temperature rise of 20°F to 10°F
[11.1°C to 5.6°C]
•
Chilled-water velocity: 3 to 8 fps [0.9 to 2.4 m/s]
•
Chilled-water pressure drop: < 20 ft of water [60 kPa]
Coil face velocity is an important design consideration. In
VAV systems, when air volume is reduced, the coil face velocity
will be reduced as well. Below about 300 fpm [1.5 m/s], laminar
flow can occur—reducing the cooling capacity of the coil. Con-
versely, coil velocities above 600 fpm [3.0 m/s] can cause moisture
carryover. For special applications, however, the range noted above
may be exceeded (see the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Systems
and Equipment).
5.4.5 Cooling Towers
Cooling towers are used to reject heat from a condenser to the
outdoor air via the use of condenser water. For large building air-
conditioning systems, vertical counterflow towers are most preva-
lent. They are equipped with either induced draft or forced draft
fans. Condenser-water systems are open systems in which air is
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐97
continuously in contact with the water, and they require a somewhat
different approach to pump selection and pipe sizing than do
closed-loop water systems. Water contact with the air introduces
impurities, which can result in continuous scaling and corrosion.
Anticipate aging of the piping, which will result in a pressure drop
that increases with time and higher-than-usual fouling factors. Con-
denser-water systems without water-regulating valves do not neces-
sarily require a strainer. Strainers provided in the cooling tower
basin or at the pump will usually be adequate. Additional design
considerations include:
•
Size the tower to avoid windage drift of tower carryover, which
might fall on adjacent buildings or parked cars (where cooling
tower water can damage paint finishes).
•
Provide water treatment and makeup systems, including water
meters to permit deduction of makeup water from sanitary
sewer charges that are based upon water consumption.
•
Winterize the tower and allow for ready availability of freeze
protection in the event of a sudden change in the weather.
•
Do not locate cooling towers near outdoor air intakes to pre-
vent excessive entering air wet-bulb temperatures and potential
bacterial contamination of intake air (e.g., Legionella).
•
Do not locate cooling towers near the building facade to avoid
staining it and to prevent the entry of noise into occupied
spaces.
Typical design values (per ton [per kW] of refrigeration)
include:
•
3.0 gpm condenser water for vapor-compression systems
[0.05 L/s]
•
3.5 gpm condenser water for absorption systems [0.06 L/s]
•
300 cfm airflow [40 L/s]
•
1/15 fan hp for induced draft (draw-through) towers
[0.014 kW]
•
1/7 fan hp for forced draft (blow-through) towers [0.03 kW]
Space requirements include:
•
8 ft [2.5 m] high towers: 1 ft2 per 500 gross ft2 [0.1 m2 per
50 m2] of building area
•
higher towers: 1 ft2 per 400 gross ft2 [0.12 m2 per 50 m2] of
building area.
98⏐ COMPONENTS
Design of piping from the tower sump to the pump should be
undertaken with caution. Place the sump level above the top of the
pump casing to provide positive prime. Pitch all piping up, either to
the tower or to the pump suction, to eliminate air pockets. Suction
strainers should be equipped with inlet and outlet gauges that indi-
cate when cleaning is required. Normally, piping is sized to yield
water velocities between 5 and 12 fps [1.5 and 3.7 m/s]. Use fric-
tion factors for aged or old pipes.
In cooling tower installations, ascertain that sufficient NPSH
(net positive suction head—see Section 5.5.2) for the condenser-
water pump is provided, and design the connections so that the flow
through each cooling tower has the same pressure drop. Install
equalizing lines of proper size between towers; otherwise, one
tower will fill and the other one will overflow. Winterize the tower
piping if necessary or provide for drain-down when pumps shut off.
In the latter case, the isolation valves must be located in a heated
space. Provide valving or sump pump isolation so that any single
cell can be serviced while the others are active.
5.4.6 Evaporative Condensers
Evaporative condensers are used to reject heat to the outdoor
air by means of the evaporation of water. Water is sprayed on the
condenser coils, and the resultant heat of vaporization, combined
with any sensible heat effect, cools the liquid inside the coils. The
residual spray water is usually recirculated. An evaporative con-
denser uses much less makeup water than a cooling tower in a con-
ventional water-cooled condenser arrangement (approximately 1.6
to 2.0 gph/ton [0.5 to 0.6 mL/s per kW] by evaporation plus 0.5 to
0.6 gph/ton [0.15 to 0.18 mL/s per kW] for bleed water). Evapora-
tive condensers are used primarily as refrigeration system condens-
ers. In such applications, they should be located as close as possible
to the refrigeration machinery to keep the refrigerant lines short. In
the winter, the water can often be shut off with the dry coil provid-
ing adequate heat rejection. Evaporative condensers are also used to
cool recirculating water in closed-loop water-source heat pump sys-
tems (see Chapter 7).
Figure 5-8 shows two evaporative condenser types using city,
well, or river makeup water. Piping should be sized in accordance
with the principles outlined in Section 5.4.5 with flow velocities of
5 to 10 fps [1.5 to 3.0 m/s]. Where city water is used, a pump is
usually not required since the water arrives under pressure. For
well or river water, pumps may be necessary, in which case the
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐99

100⏐ COMPONENTS
procedure for pump sizing is generally that indicated below for
cooling tower systems. For practical purposes, the velocity head is
insignificant and can usually be ignored in these systems. Since
evaporative condensers have little storage capacity, liquid receivers
(see Section 5.2.1) should be installed downstream of such con-
densers to hold the refrigerant until it is required by the system.
5.5 PUMPS
5.5.1 General Characteristics
Pumps are used to circulate various liquids in an HVAC&R
system. The different types of centrifugal pumps and their applica-
tions in HVAC&R systems are treated in the ASHRAE Hand-
book—HVAC Systems and Equipment. Centrifugal pumps are most
prevalent in HVAC&R systems. Table 5-1 shows some of the

effects of variations in system or operating parameters on pump
performance. The use of pump curves for system design is
explained in Section 8.8.
5.5.2 Net Positive Suction Head
To eliminate cavitation, a certain minimum net positive suction
head (NPSH) must be maintained at the inlet of a pump. The
required NSPH for a specific pump is available from the manufac-
turer, either from catalog data or on request. Although usually given
as a single number, NPSH increases with flow. The required NPSH
can be considered as the pressure required to overcome pump inlet
losses and to keep water flowing into the pump without the forma-
tion of vapor bubbles, which are the cause of cavitation. A piping
system will produce an available NPSH that reflects its design and
installation conditions. For satisfactory pump operation, the avail-
able NPSH must always exceed the required NPSH; if it does not,
bubbles and pockets of vapor will form in the pump. The results
will be a reduction in capacity, loss of efficiency, noise, vibration,
and cavitation. The available NPSH in a system is expressed by
available NPSH = Pa + Ps + V2/2g – hvpa – hf ,
(5-8)
where
available NPSH = net positive suction head available;
Pa
= atmospheric pressure at elevation of installa-
tion, ft [kPa];
Ps
= water pressure at pump centerline, ft [kPa];
V2/2g
= velocity pressure at pump centerline, ft [kPa];
hvpa
= absolute vapor pressure at pumping tempera-
ture, ft [kPa]; and
hf
= friction and entrance head losses in the suction
piping, ft [kPa].
Net positive suction head is not normally a concern in closed
systems. It also is not ordinarily a factor in open systems unless hot
fluids are pumped, the suction lift is large, a cooling tower outlet
and its pump inlet are at approximately the same elevation, or there
is considerable friction in the pump suction pipe. Insufficient avail-
able NPSH can occur because of undersized piping, too many fit-
tings, if a valve in the suction line is throttled, or if the mesh of a
strainer on the suction side of a pump becomes clogged.
Example 5-2. The pump in Figure 5-9 has a NPSH of 22.4 ft
[67 kPa] of water. The pressure loss in the suction piping is 4.6 ft of
102⏐ COMPONENTS
water [13.8 kPa], and L equals 12 ft [3.7 m]. Determine the addi-
tional lift available from the pump.
Solution: The additional lift equals the NPSH minus the suc-
tion head and piping pressure losses. Additional lift = 22.4 – 4.6 –
12 = 5.8 ft of water [17.3 kPa].
5.6 VALVES
5.6.1 Valve Types
The following valve types are regularly used in HVAC systems.
Ball and butterfly valves operate from the fully open to the fully
closed position with a 90° turn. They can be used for throttling and
offer very low resistance to flow when fully open.
Balancing valves are provided for flow measurement and adjust-
ment purposes.
Check valves prevent flow reversal. They can be spring-loaded to
close before an actual reversal of flow occurs.
Gate valves are intended to be either open or fully closed and are
not used for throttling. They offer low resistance to flow when fully
open.
Figure 5-9. Pump with suction lift.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐103
Globe valves are used for throttling and have high resistance to
flow.
Pressure-reducing valves are used to maintain a constant down-
stream pressure under varying flow and pressure conditions.
Pressure-relief valves open, when system pressure reaches a preset
level, to prevent overpressure in a system.
Control valves provide for automatic operations by means of an
actuator mounted to the valve body, which imparts a push-pull or a
rotary motion to the valve stem. Control valves are available with
electric, hydraulic (pneumatic), thermostatic, or self-operated actua-
tors. A control valve provided with an automatic controller and sen-
sor becomes part of an automated control system (see Chapter 10).
5.6.2 Valve Characteristics
The internal design of a valve determines its performance char-
acteristics (percent flow versus percent stroke) as the valve is posi-
tioned from open to closed. Three typical characteristics—quick
opening, linear, and equal percentage—are shown in Figure 5-10 at
Figure 5-10. Typical valve flow characteristics.
104⏐ COMPONENTS
constant pressure drop. The quick-opening characteristic is usually
applied where a process requires essentially ON/OFF operation. For
example, a preheat coil in an outdoor air duct may be operated by a
quick-opening valve, the controller of which has a sensor in the out-
door air.
A linear valve gives a uniform percentage change in flow for
each percentage change in valve position. A typical application
would be on a steam-heating coil operated by a controller whose
sensor is on the discharge side of the coil. Since the coil output is
uniform with steam flow, a linear valve provides a uniform change
in temperature as the proportional controller increases or
decreases the valve position to match the load to maintain a tem-
perature setpoint.
An equal-percentage valve gives a very gradual change in flow
for each percentage change in valve position near the closed posi-
tion and a very rapid increase in flow near the fully open position.
An example is the control of a hydronic heating or cooling coil. The
nonlinear coil heat transfer characteristic (Figure 5-11a) is counter-
acted by the equal-percentage valve characteristic (Figure 5-11b),
resulting in a nearly linear coil output. The flow-versus-valve-posi-
tion characteristics (Figure 5-11c) assist the controller in matching
the flow to the load and minimizing coil discharge fluctuations.
5.6.3 Valve Sizing
Sizing of control valves should be undertaken by determining
the Cv (valve coefficient) required to provide the design flow condi-
tions at full load, i.e., in the wide-open position. Manufacturers fur-
nish values of Cv coefficients for each valve size. By definition, the
Cv coefficient is the flow (in gpm) through a wide-open valve at a
1 psi pressure drop across the valve [or SI equivalents]. For water
(with a specific gravity of 1), this reduces to
Q = Cv (Δp)0.5 ,
(5-11)
where
Q
=
flow rate, gpm (m3/s);
Cv
=
required valve coefficient; and
Δp =
pressure drop across valve, psi (Pa).
For steam, this formula becomes
Ws = 2.1 Cv [(p1 + p2) (p1 – p2)]0.5 ,
(5-12)
where
Cv = required valve coefficient;
p1
= valve inlet pressure, psia;
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐105
p2
= valve outlet pressure, psia; and
Ws = full-load steam flow rate, lb/h.
[For SI applications, multiply g/s by 7.94 to get lb/h; multiply kPa
by 0.145 to get psi.]
5.6.4 Applications
Two-way valves vary the volume of water flowing through a
heat transfer coil (Figure 5-12) and associated distribution circuit.
Systems with two-way valve controls must provide for variable
flow conditions. Constant system flow volume can be maintained
by varying the volume of water flowing through the coil while
allowing a bypass flow around the coil using a three-way mixing
valve located on the leaving side of the coil (Figure 5-13). A more
expensive three-way diverting valve, located on the entering side of
Figure 5-11. Characteristics of cooling or heating coil and equal-per-
centage control valve.
106⏐ COMPONENTS
the coil, varies the volume of water flowing through the coil and
diverts flow around the coil as the coil flow is decreased.
The application of valves to air-and-water systems is treated in
Chapter 7; their application to all-water systems is treated in Sec-
tion 8.7.
5.7 PIPING
The design of piping systems is described in the “Pipe Siz-
ing” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals, while
physical pipe sizes are given in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC
Figure 5-12. Two-way valve controlling hot water circuit.
Figure 5-13. Three-way valve controlling chilled-water circuit.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐107
Systems and Equipment. Assume a value of C = 100 for old or
dirty pipe (i.e., in open systems), 140 for new steel pipe, and 150
for plastic or copper tube/pipe in the Hazen-Williams equation.
Friction loss in hydronic systems is usually between 1 and 5 ft per
100 ft of pipe [10 to 50 kPa per 100 m], with an average of 2.5 ft
per 100 ft [25 kPa per 100 m]. Typically, add 50% to the friction
loss from the straight length of piping to account for fittings. The
following rule is often used to account for the pressure drop in
elbows: the equivalent straight length of pipe (in feet) for an
elbow equals twice the nominal pipe diameter (in inches). Thus, a
1 in. [25 mm] elbow causes the same friction loss as 2 ft [0.6 m]
of straight 1 in. [25 mm] pipe. Pumping power (for water, with a
specific gravity of 1) is estimated from
bhp = (gpm) (head of water, ft) / (3960) (pump efficiency) (5-14)
[kW = (L/s) (head of water, kPa) / (1002) (pump efficiency)]
with pump efficiencies ranging from 0.40 to 0.60 for small pump
capacities and from 0.70 to 0.85 for larger pumps.
To calculate the appropriate size of compression/expansion
tanks, use the table in the “Hydronic Heating and Cooling System
Design” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Systems and
Equipment that lists volumes in gallons per foot of pipe [L per m].
The water volumes in chillers, coils, heat exchangers, etc., must be
added to those volumes.
Approximate parameters for air control expansion tanks are
•
16% of total water volume for chilled water;
•
20% of total water volume for hot water under standard sea
level conditions and 30 to 40 ft [90 to 120 kPa] static head;
•
12 psig [83 kPa] fill pressure, 30 psig [207 kPa] relief valve; and
•
200°F [93°C] hot water, 44°F [6.7°C] chilled water.
Tank sizes as estimated above can usually be cut in half if com-
pression tanks, which contain a diaphragm that maintains separa-
tion between the air cushion and the water, are used.
If antifreeze liquids are used, the reduced thermal capacity
(specific heat) and increased viscosity of these liquids compared to
water (see the “Secondary Coolants (Brines)” chapter in the
ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals) must be considered. For
example, the flow resistance of a 30% glycol aqueous solution is
15% greater than that of water. Drag-reducing agents may be able
to offset these conditions.

low-rise office building are shown in Table 5-2. The information is
based upon manufacturers’ data, except where noted. Both pressur-
ized and open systems are considered.
5.7.1 Air Control and Venting
If air and other gases are not eliminated from a hydronic piping
circuit, they may cause “air binding” in terminal heat transfer ele-
ments and noise and/or reduction in flow in the piping circuit. Pip-
ing can be run level, provided flow velocities in excess of 1.5 fps
[0.5 m/s] are maintained. Otherwise, piping should pitch up in the
direction of flow to a high point containing an air vent or a runout to
a room terminal unit. Vent high points in piping systems and termi-
nal units with manual or automatic air vents. As automatic air vents
may malfunction, provide valves at each vent to permit servicing
without draining the system. Pipe the discharge of each vent to a
point where water can be wasted into a drain or container to prevent
damage to the surroundings. If a standard compression or expan-
sion tank is used, free air contained in the circulating water can be
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐109
removed from the piping circuit and trapped in the expansion tank
by air-separation devices. If a diaphragm-type tank is used, vent all
air from the system.

5.7.2 Drains, Shutoffs, and Strainers
Equip all low points with drains. Provide separate shutoff and
drain valves for individual equipment pieces so that an entire system
does not have to be drained to service a single piece of equipment.
Use strainers where necessary to protect equipment. Strainers placed
in the suction of a pump must be large enough to avoid cavitation.
Large separating chambers, which serve as main air-venting points
and dirt strainers ahead of pumps, are available. Automatic control
valves or spray nozzles operating with small clearances or openings
require protection from pipe scale, welding slag, etc., which may
readily pass through a pump and its protective separator. Individual
fine mesh strainers are often required ahead of each control valve.
5.7.3 Thermometers and Gauges
Include thermometers or thermometer wells to assist the sys-
tem operator, the test and balance technician, the commissioning
team, and for use in troubleshooting. Install permanent thermome-
ters with correct scale range, easy-to-read display, and separable
sockets at all points where temperature readings are regularly
needed. Thermometer wells should be installed where readings will
be needed only during start-up, balancing, and commissioning.
Install gage cocks at points where pressure readings will be
required. Gauges permanently installed in a system tend to deterio-
rate due to vibration and pulsation, and cannot be counted on to
provide reliable readings over the long haul. A single gauge con-
nected to both supply and return piping with appropriate valving
will permit checking of pressure differential with an informal type
of self-calibration.
5.7.4 Flexible Connectors
Flexible connectors at pumps and other machinery help reduce
the transfer of vibration from equipment to piping. Flexible connec-
tors also prevent damage caused by misalignment and thermal
expansion/contraction of equipment piping. Vibration can be trans-
mitted across a flexible connection, however, through flowing
water, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the connector.
5.8 DUCTWORK

the “Duct Design” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamen-
tals, which explains all three methods in detail.
The “Duct Design” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fun-
damentals and the HVAC Systems—Duct Design manual
(SMACNA 1990) contain extensive tabulations of pressure losses
in ducts. Manufacturers’ data are also readily available. Rough-
ness factors for other than smooth sheet metal ducts can also be
found in these references. Internal linings may add 25% to 40% to
air resistance, while flexible ducts may add 50%. The latter
require special attention so that they remain round and do not col-
lapse or become crushed.
Recommended cfm per square foot [L/s per m2] values for differ-
ent conditions are given in the ASHRAE Pocket Guide (2005). Mini-
mum ventilation (outdoor air) requirements are given in Standards
62.1 and 62.2 or in local codes, which, if they exist, supersede the
standard. For supply air systems, use approximate pressure losses of:
•
0.08 in. of water per 100 linear ft of duct [0.66 Pa per m] for
quiet areas
•
0.10 in. of water per 100 linear ft of duct [0.82 Pa per m] for
ordinary areas
•
0.15 in. of water per 100 linear ft of duct [1.21 Pa per m] for
factory areas.
A pressure loss analysis for a typical 10,000 ft2 [930 m2]
low-rise office building is shown in Table 5-4. Data are based upon
manufacturers’ data or are from SMACNA’s HVAC Systems—Duct
Design except where noted.
A prudent designer will add a reasonable safety factor to these
values to ensure that adequate fan capacity and power have been
provided for the system.
Fan power for a ductwork system can be estimated as described
in Section 4.5.2. Typical fan efficiencies range from 0.40 to 0.50 for
small fans and from 0.55 to 0.60 for large fans.
Outdoor air (for ventilation or makeup) must equal exhaust air
plus exfiltration at all times. Exhaust air fans will cause the infiltra-
tion of outdoor air unless supply/makeup fans supply a quantity of
outdoor air equal to the exhausted plus exfiltrated air. Ignoring this
fact may lead to frozen coils or sprinkler piping in cold climates.
Buildings should be pressurized to reduce or prevent infiltration. It
is customary, therefore, to supply approximately 5% to 10% more
outdoor air than exhaust air to account for exfiltration.

Building static pressure controls need to reference outdoor
ambient conditions. The outdoor air sensor must not be sensitive to
weather or wind effects. Also, use a large chamber to dampen sud-
den variations in pressure readings.
Standard louvers, hoods, and other air intake openings are usu-
ally sized at 500 to 800 fpm [2.5 to 4.1 m/s] through the free area of
the opening. Storm-proof (drainable) louvers should be used to
reduce the entry of rain/snow. Specification of louver free area must
be coordinated with the architect. Install flashings at the exterior
wall and have weep holes or a floor drain to carry away rain or
melted snow entering the intake. In cold regions, a snow baffle may
be required to direct fine snow particles to a low-velocity area
below the dampers. At maximum airflow, overall resistance of the
louver, dampers, and outdoor air intake duct should approximately
equal the resistance of the return air systems.
Construct relief openings in large buildings similarly to outdoor
air intakes but equip them with motorized or building pressure-oper-
ated backdraft dampers to prevent reversal of airflow caused by high
wind pressures or building stack action when the automatic dampers
are open. Detail self-acting dampers to prevent rattling.

6.1 CONTEXT
This chapter and the following chapters on air-and-water and
all-water systems are based upon a common context. Key to this
context is the idea of a thermal “zone.” A zone is an area of a
building that must be provided with separate control if design
intent is to be met. From an HVAC system perspective, the design
intent that is most commonly of concern when establishing zones
is the provision of thermal comfort. Providing for acceptable
indoor air quality may also influence zoning decisions (as is noted
later relative to VAV system analysis). Zoning should be estab-
lished before system selection. Although costs and budget will
typically influence system selection and the number of zones that
can be reasonably provided, selection of a system that cannot pro-
vide the necessary zones means selection of a system that cannot
provide desired comfort or indoor air quality.
All central HVAC systems are assembled from four functional
subsystems: a source subsystem, a distribution subsystem, a deliv-
ery subsystem, and a control subsystem. Source elements are dis-
cussed in Chapter 5 (along with components such as pumps and
fans that compose the distribution subsystem). Controls are dis-
cussed in Chapter 10. Distribution (moving heating/cooling effect
from the source to the spaces requiring conditioning) and delivery
(introducing the heating/cooling effect into each zone) are essen-
tially the focus of Chapters 6, 7, and 8, which discuss all-air, air-
and-water, and all-water distribution/delivery approaches.
6.2 INTRODUCTION
Familiarity with the information on all-air systems presented in
the “Building Air Distribution” chapter of the ASHRAE Handbook—
CHAPTER 6
ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
116⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
HVAC Systems and Equipment, which gives a general description of
these types of systems, is assumed in this manual. Fundamental
material from that resource is generally not repeated here.
All-air systems provide sensible and latent cooling capacity
solely through cold supply air delivered to the conditioned space.
No supplemental cooling is provided by refrigeration sources
within the zones and no chilled water is supplied to the zones. Heat-
ing may be accomplished by the same supply airstream, with the
heat source located either in the central system equipment or in a
terminal device serving a zone. A zone is an area controlled by a
thermostat, while a room refers to a partitioned area that may or
may not have a separate thermostat.
The psychrometrics of air-conditioning systems are treated in
detail in this chapter. Much of this psychrometric discussion is also
applicable to the air-and-water and all-water systems discussed in
Chapters 7 and 8.
6.3 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF
ALL-AIR SYSTEMS
The general advantages of central systems (including all-air
systems) are:
•
Major equipment is centrally located in dedicated service
spaces, which allows maintenance to take place in unoccupied
areas.
•
Major noise-generating equipment is centrally located in a
space that can be acoustically isolated, allowing for reasonable
noise control opportunities.
•
There is no condensate drain piping or HVAC power wiring in
occupied areas (as opposed to unitary or fan-coil systems).
Among the specific advantages of all-air systems are:
•
Such systems are well suited to air-side economizer use, heat
recovery, winter humidification, and large-volume outdoor air
requirements.
•
They are the best choice for close control of zone temperature
and humidity.
•
They are generally a good choice for applications where indoor
air quality is a key concern.
•
They are amenable to use in smoke control systems.
•
There is simple seasonal changeover.
•
Such systems generally permit simultaneous heating and cool-
ing in different zones.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐117
Among the disadvantages of all-air systems are:
•
All-air systems use significant amounts of energy to move air
(approximately 40% of all-air system energy use is fan
energy).
•
Ductwork space requirements may add to building height.
•
Air balancing may be difficult.
•
It is difficult to provide comfort in locations with low outdoor
temperatures and typical building envelope performance when
warm air is used for perimeter heating.
•
Providing ready maintenance accessibility to terminal devices
requires close coordination between mechanical, architectural,
and structural designers.
All-air systems that have been used in buildings of various
types are presented below. Not all of these systems are equally valid
in the context of a given project. Not all of these systems see equal
use in today’s design environment. They are presented, however, to
provide a sense of the possibilities and constraints inherent in the
use of an all-air HVAC system.
6.4 SYSTEM CONCEPTS AND
BASIC PSYCHROMETRICS
Procedures for the calculation of air-conditioning cooling loads
are presented in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals and are
summarized in Chapter 4 of this manual. Proper representation of
each load on a psychrometric chart will help you understand the
interaction of the loads and their effects on system design.
Figure 6-1a shows a schematic diagram of a representative sin-
gle-duct, single-zone, all-air system. Figure 6-1b shows a psychro-
metric analysis for this system in cooling mode; Figure 6-1c shows
a heating mode analysis. Heat flows (denoted as q) and airflows are
indicated by arrows, and temperatures are indicated as t. Subscripts
identifying points in the sequence of airflow are:
R = room
rp = return plenum
rd = return duct
o = outdoor air
m = mixed air
cc = cooling coil leaving air temperature
hc = heating coil leaving air temperature
rf = return air fan

sf = supply air fan
sd = supply ductwork
s
= supply

metric chart.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐119
The room sensible and latent loads in Figure 6-1b are denoted
by qSR and qLR, respectively, and the outdoor air sensible and latent
loads are denoted by qSo and qLo, respectively. The total cooling
load qcc is defined by the difference in enthalpies between states m
and cc.
Note that the air discharged from the cooling coil absorbs heat
from the supply air fan and the supply air ductwork—before air
enters the room—accounting for the difference in dry-bulb temper-
ature between points cc and s in Figure 6-1b. Room sensible and
latent loads due to occupants, lights, equipment, solar radiation,
opaque envelope transmission, etc., are picked up and carried to the
return air plenum by the return airstream. Additional heat may be
picked up from recessed light fixtures, a floor or roof above, and a
return air fan, accounting for the increase in temperature between
points R and r. Some of the air is exhausted, while outdoor ventila-
tion air (o) is taken in, resulting in a mixed airstream condition m,
which is cooled and dehumidified by the cooling coils, producing
the state of air at cc. In this arrangement a heating coil is provided
immediately downstream of the cooling coil to raise the air temper-
ature as required to provide winter heating. Usually, the heating coil
is upstream of the cooling coil and acts as a preheating coil in win-
ter. Such an arrangement provides some freeze protection for a
chilled water cooling coil.
Depending upon exactly how air is supplied to and exhausted
from a room, larger or smaller portions of the heat gain from the
lighting system may be either added to the other heat loads in the
room or picked up in the return air plenum. This is explained in
detail in the “Nonresidential Air-Conditioning Cooling and Heating
Load” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals. For the
case when return air is routed through light fixtures, the approxi-
mate fractions of heat removed by the return airstream under differ-
ent conditions are shown in Table 6-1. Note that some designers
believe these values are high.

120⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
When a substantial portion of the heat of lighting is removed
by the return airstream (thus reducing room cooling load), room
supply air volume in a lightly loaded space may fall short of the
minimum ventilation air design criteria, particularly under part-load
operation of a variable-air-volume system. Various methods to
avoid this problem are described later.
6.5 SPECIAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
6.5.1 Pressure Considerations
All-air systems may be designed for high or low velocity air
distribution. Higher pressures may be desirable in some low-veloc-
ity systems for improved ease of balancing and/or for use of flow
control regulators, which have a substantial pressure drop. Higher
pressures are required with high-velocity systems to overcome
greater friction losses in the ductwork. Make every effort to reduce
the total energy needed to deliver the required airflow in a system.
This will ensure a quieter system, reduce duct leakage, and, in the
majority of cases, minimize operating costs. Duct design methods
are noted in Section 5.8, which also presents maximum and recom-
mended velocities for high-pressure and low-pressure systems.
The chief justification for the use of high duct velocities is lim-
ited space for ductwork. Most designs have choke points where
ducts must be restricted in size. As a result, the air velocity at such
points must be high. As soon as these points are passed and space
becomes available, lower duct velocities should be restored to
reduce friction and the velocity then gradually decreased further
toward the far end of the duct system. A substantial saving in duct
friction is usually achieved by carefully studying the duct mains
adjacent to the air-handling room. The connections from plenums
to main supply ducts should be as streamlined as possible to reduce
the friction loss at the entrance to the main distribution duct. In
practice, this is usually accomplished by using a transitional fitting
between the ductwork and the plenum. In many cases, space/vol-
ume is available at the air-handling room, and a large duct can be
used in this area. The duct velocity can then be stepped up gradu-
ally as the point of maximum space restriction is reached.
Return air ducts should be sized for low velocities. One way to
simplify the return air system is to use suspended ceiling plenums
or corridors as return “ducts” and to collect the return air at central
points on each floor. In some localities, however, there are code
restrictions to this method.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐121
One way to assist in providing a quiet installation is to provide
a length of lined ductwork on the leaving side of terminal units
when the system layout permits. Acoustically lined ductwork, espe-
cially when it contains one or two elbows, is a reasonably effective
sound attenuator. It will provide a necessary acoustical safety factor
if noise regeneration occurs in the air distribution system because of
poorly constructed ducts, fittings, or taps. Noise and vibration con-
trol are treated in more detail in Section 2.5.3.
6.5.2 Air Temperature-Volume Considerations
The volume of air required to condition any space can be gov-
erned by the room design sensible cooling load, by the room dehu-
midification or humidification (latent) load, or by room ventilation
requirements. (In HVAC terminology, ventilation refers to outdoor
or fresh airflow, not to total air circulation.) Ventilation require-
ments, however, are rarely the governing condition, although they
may govern under minimum supply air conditions in vari-
able-air-volume (VAV) systems (see Section 6.8) or in rooms with
high occupancy or high exhaust air requirements.
Although loads, ventilation or air movement requirements, and
equipment limitations may to some extent predetermine supply air
volume and temperature values, the system designer often has some
latitude in selecting the temperature-volume relationship. Weigh the
economics of low-volume (high delta-t) supply air against possible
distribution, odor, or air movement problems. Low-volume air sup-
ply (resulting from lower-than-normal supply air temperatures)
increases operating costs for refrigeration, although overall operat-
ing costs (considering both refrigeration and air distribution sys-
tems) do not necessarily increase. Low supply temperatures may
cause drafts and condensation on diffuser/register surfaces. For
occupant comfort, it is undesirable to inject air into a room that is
more than 20°F (11°C) colder than the room air temperature. When
the supply air is colder than that, for example, in cold air systems
(see Section 9.3.8), supply air must be mixed with induced room air
inside the supply terminal before being injected into the room.
6.6 USEFUL EQUATIONS FOR AIR-SIDE SYSTEM DESIGN
6.6.1 Basic Calculations
1.
Sensible heat capacity or load; qs, Btu/h [W]
qs = (specific heat) (density) (mass flow rate) (temperature difference)
122⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
qs = (0.244 Btu/lb °F) (0.075 lb/ft3) (60 min/h) (cfm) (Δt)
qs = (1.1) (cfm) (Δt)
(6-1a)
[qs = (1.006 kJ/kg⋅K) (1.204 kg/m3) (1000 W/s kJ) (0.001 L/m3) (Δt)]
[qs = (1.2) (L/s) (Δt)]
(6-1b)
where
qs
= sensible heat corresponding to a change in dry-bulb temper-
ature (Δt) for a given volumetric flow of standard air
cfm = airflow rate of standard air [L/s]
(While the specific heat of air is 0.240 Btu/lb [0.558 kJ/kg], the
value 0.244 [0.568] represents the specific heat of air with an aver-
age of 1% moisture.)
2.
Latent heat capacity or load; qL, Btu/h [W]
qL = (latent heat of vaporization) (mass flow rate) (difference in
humidity ratio)
qL = (1076 Btu/lb water) (0.075 lb air/ft3) (60 min/h) (ΔW)
qL = (4840) (cfm) (ΔW)
(6-2a)
also equal to (0.69) (cfm) (ΔG)
[qL = (2503 kJ/kg water) (1.20 kg air/m3) (0.001 L/m3) (ΔW)]
[qL = (3.0) (L/s) (ΔW)]
(6-2b)
where
qL = latent heat corresponding to the change in (absolute) humid-
ity ratio
ΔW= change in humidity ratio, pound of water per pound of dry air
[g/kg]
ΔG = change in humidity ratio, grains of water per pound of dry air
for given volumetric flow of standard air, where 7000 grains
equal 1 pound
3.
Total heat capacity or load; qt, Btu/h [W]
qt = (air mass flow rate) (change in enthalpy)
qt = (0.075 lb/ft3) (60 min/h) (cfm) (Δh)
qt = (4.5) (cfm) (Δh)
(6-3a)
= qs + qL
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐123
[qt = (1.20 kg air/m3) (0.001 L/m3) (1000 W/s kJ) (L/s) (Δh)]
[qt = (1.2) (L/s) (Δh)]
(6-3b)
= qs + qL
where
qt = total heat corresponding to change in enthalpy for given volu-
metric flow of standard air
Δh= difference in enthalpy, Btu/lb [kJ/kg]
4.
Air Mixtures
When air flowing at a rate of cfm1 [L/s1] at temperature t1 and
humidity ratio W1 mixes with another airflow of cfm2 [L/s2] at t2 <
t1 and W2 < W1 to yield a mixed condition of cfmm [L/sm] at tm and
Wm, then
cfmm = cfml + cfm2 (L/sm = L/sl + L/s2)
(6-4)
tm = t2 + (t1 – t2) (cfm1 / cfmm)
(6-5a)
[tm = t2 + (t1 – t2) (L/s1 / L/sm)]
or
tm = tl – (tl – t2) (cfm1 / cfmm)
(6-5b)
[tm = tl – (tl – t2) (L/s1 / L/sm)]
Wm = W2 + (Wl – W2) (cfm1 / cfmm)
(6-6a)
[Wm = W2 + (Wl – W2) (L/s1 / L/sm)]
or
Wm = Wl – (W1 – W2) (cfm2 / cfmm)
(6-6b)
[Wm = Wl – (W1 – W2) (L/s2 / L/sm)]
In the above-mentioned equations, t applies to either dry-bulb
or wet-bulb air temperature. Such mixing processes, plotted on a
standard psychrometric chart, fall on a straight line drawn between
states 1 and 2, with the distances from these points inversely pro-
portional to the respective flow rates.
6.6.2 Fan Laws
The fan laws are used to predict the effect on fan performance
of a change in the properties of air, fan operating speed, or fan size.
The fan laws are given here in one of their several variations (see
the ASHRAE Pocket Guide or the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Sys-
tems and Equipment for these laws in equation format). Five com-
monly used versions of the fan laws state:
124⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
1.
Given a variation in fan speed—constant density of air, con-
stant system (no change in ductwork or damper position)—
then:
Q varies as rpm
SP varies as rpm2
VP varies as rpm2
P varies as rpm3
where
Q
= flow rate of air
SP = static pressure
VP = velocity pressure
P
= fan power
2.
Given a variation in fan size—similar fan proportions, constant
rpm, constant air density—then:
Q varies as D3
SP varies as D2
P varies as D5
where
D = diameter of fan wheel
3.
Given a variation in air density—constant system, constant fan
size, constant fan speed—then:
Q remains constant
SP varies as air density
P varies as air density
4.
Given a variation in air density—constant static pressure, con-
stant system, constant fan size, variable rpm—then:
Q varies as (air density)–0.5
SP is constant
rpm varies as (air density)–0.5
P varies as (air density)–0.5
5.
Given a variation in air density—constant mass flow of air,
constant system, constant fan size, variable rpm—then:
Q varies as the reciprocal of air density
SP varies as the reciprocal of air density
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐125
rpm varies as the reciprocal of air density
P varies as (air density)–2
Some typical applications of the fan laws are presented below.
Fan law 1. To find the necessary increase in fan rpm to increase the
airflow rate by a specified amount.
Fan law 2. To find the necessary change in fan size to achieve a
greater flow rate, with operating speed remaining constant.
Fan law 3. To find the change in static pressure and power if air
density changes but fan speed remains constant.
Fan law 4. To find the speed change necessary to maintain a certain
static pressure if air density changes.
Fan law 5. To find the amount by which rpm must be changed when
air density changes if a fixed mass rate of airflow is to be main-
tained (for example, to preserve a change in temperature across a
heat exchanger with a fixed rate of heat addition).
Fan laws 1 and 5 are most often used in design. If system test-
ing and balancing shows that a 15% greater flow rate is required,
fan law 1 indicates, not only how much the fan speed must be
increased, but what the consequences are on the power draw of the
fan motor. Fan law 5 may be used when the air handled by a fan and
duct system is at an appreciably different temperature from the tem-
perature for which equipment ratings are available. This fan law
may also be used when designing systems to operate at high alti-
tudes (and, thus, lower atmospheric pressures than sea level). Fan
law 3 may provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the change in
fan size needed to achieve a revised flow rate, but realistically it
would be better to consult a fan manufacturer’s catalog for such
information.
Example 6-1. A fan installed in a new system operates at
800 rpm and provides a measured flow rate of 4100 cfm [1935 L/s]
working against a static pressure of 2.8 in. of water [697 Pa]. The
catalog rating of the fan at these conditions specifies a power
requirement of 4.5 hp [3.4 kW], and a 5 hp [3.7 kW] motor has been
selected. Instead of the current flow rate of 4100 cfm [1935 L/s],
4500 cfm [2124 L/s] is desired. What are the consequences of
increasing the fan speed to achieve 4500 cfm [2124 L/s]?
126⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
Solution: Fan law 1 states that, with constant air density and
system characteristics, Q varies linearly with rpm.
a.
The fan speed must, therefore, be changed to: (800) (4500 /
4100) = 878 rpm, or by a ratio of 1.0975 [the same pattern
applies to flows in L/s].
b.
The new static pressure will be (2.8) (1.0975)2 = 3.37 in. of
water [839 Pa].
c.
The revised power requirement will be (4.5) (1.0975)3 =
5.95 hp [4.4 kW], which will likely necessitate changing the
5 hp [3.7 kW] motor to a 7.5 hp [5.6 kW] motor. Figure 6-2
shows the original and revised operating conditions.
Example 6-2. Measurements made on a newly installed
air-handling system show: 1200 rpm fan speed, 4500 cfm
[2124 L/s], l.9 in. of water [473 Pa] static pressure, and 3 hp
[2.2 kW] shaft power when the air temperature is 70°F [21.1°C]
and the pressure is standard atmospheric. In actual use, the fan
and duct system are to handle 150°F [65.6°C] air. If the fan
speed remains 1200 rpm, what will be (a) the volume rate of
airflow, (b) the static pressure, and (c) the power requirement?
Solution: Fan law 3 applies because the air density changes, but
the fan speed, fan size, and system characteristics remain constant.
a.
The volume rate of flow remains constant at 4500 cfm [2124 L/s].
The mass rate of flow, however, decreases because the air density

AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐127
at 150°F [65.6°C] is 0.065 lb/ft3 [1.04 kg/m3] in comparison to
0.0749 lb/ft3 [1.20 kg/m3] at the original conditions.
b.
The static pressure varies in proportion to the air density, so
SP = (1.9) (0.065 / 0.0749) = 1.65 in. of water [411 Pa].
c.
The power varies in proportion to the air density, so P = (3 hp)
(0.065 / 0.0749) = 2.61 hp [1.95 kW].
In the selection and operation of a combination of supply and
return air fans, an underlying objective is to regulate the air pres-
sures in the occupied spaces so that they are close to outdoor atmo-
spheric pressure—usually just slightly higher to reduce infiltration.
This objective becomes a special challenge in VAV systems (Sec-
tion 6.8), where the duct-damper characteristics are constantly
changing as the zone loads change.
6.7 SINGLE-ZONE ALL-AIR SYSTEMS
The simplest form of HVAC&R system is a single refrigeration
machine serving a single temperature control zone (as shown in
Figure 6-1). The equipment may be installed within or remote from
the space it serves and may operate with or without distributing
ductwork. If located within the zone being conditioned and without
substantial ductwork, the system is termed a local system. If located
remote from the zone(s) being served and with distribution duct-
work, the system is termed a central system. Properly designed sys-
tems of either type can closely and effectively maintain temperature
and humidity and can be shut down when desired without affecting
the conditioning of other areas. They are fairly energy efficient, easy
to control, and easily adaptable to economizer cycles (see Section
9.3.7). Their disadvantage is that they respond to only one set of
space conditions. Their use is therefore limited to situations where
variations occur approximately uniformly throughout the space
served or where the load is stable—i.e., a single-zone situation.
Single-zone systems are applicable to small department stores,
small individual stores in a shopping center, individual classrooms
in a school, computer rooms, hospital operating rooms, and large
open areas (such as gymnasiums, atriums, and warehouses). A roof-
top unit, complete with refrigeration system, serving an individual
space is considered a single-zone system. The refrigeration system,
however, may be remote and may serve several single-zone units in
a larger installation. A return fan is necessary only if 100% outdoor
air is used for cooling, and even then it may be eliminated if air can
be relieved from the space with very little pressure loss through the
relief system.
128⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
Units that incorporate all the components of an air-condition-
ing system except ductwork and condenser water piping are
referred to as self-contained or packaged units because they contain
a refrigeration compressor, a direct expansion coil, the refrigeration
piping, a fan and motor, filter, and controls, all in one casing. In
many cases, a heating coil is also included. Sometimes the units are
attached to ductwork, but frequently they are used with a free-dis-
charge register or diffuser. Such units are manufactured with either
water-cooled or air-cooled condensers and with or without gas heat-
ing units.
Frequently the fan and evaporator section of self-contained
units is mounted in or next to the conditioned space, and the com-
pressor-condenser unit is mounted on the roof or at some other
remote location (see Section 6.12). In this case, refrigerant piping
must be installed to connect the evaporator and the compressor in
an arrangement referred to as a split system. A building using multi-
ple split-system units has a collection of single-zone systems.
A single-zone system can be controlled by varying the quantity
or the temperature of the supply air through the use of reheat, face
and bypass dampers, volume control devices, or a combination of
these. Single-duct systems without reheat offer cooling flexibility
but cannot control humidity independently of temperature. Sin-
gle-duct systems with reheat provide flexibility in both temperature
and humidity control; a cooling coil cools the supply air to the
desired humidity, and a reheat coil raises the dry-bulb temperature
to the desired value. Standard 90.1, however, severely restricts the
application of reheat, limiting this option to special cases. A sepa-
rate humidifier and/or dehumidifier may have to be provided if tight
control of humidity is required.
Appendix B presents sample design calculations for a sin-
gle-zone system.
6.8 VARIABLE-AIR-VOLUME (VAV) SYSTEMS
6.8.1 System Concepts
In constant-air-volume systems, cooling or heating control is
accomplished by varying the supply air temperature while the vol-
ume of supply air remains constant. VAV systems accomplish cool-
ing/heating control by maintaining constant air temperature while
varying the volume of the air supply. Both control approaches have
benefits and disadvantages.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐129
6.8.1.1 Simple VAV. This system applies to cooling-only
applications with no requirement for simultaneous heating and
cooling in different zones. A typical application is the interior of an
office building. There are several means of varying system airflow
in response to zone loads. Variations in system supply volume can
occur without fan volume variation through use of a fan bypass.
This type of control, however, negates the potential of fan energy
savings available with a VAV system. VFDs (variable-frequency
drives) are reliable and relatively inexpensive, making a bypass
control approach unwise. Alternatively, a varying zone air volume
can be obtained (while fan and system volume remain substantially
constant) by dumping excess supply air into a return air ceiling ple-
num or directly into the return air duct system. Dumping cold air
into a return air plenum, however, wastes energy and can cause
overcooling under low load conditions due to air leakage through
the ceiling system and radiant cooling from the ceiling surface.
Dumping can also cause a shortage of system supply volume if it is
used for system balancing as well as a means of temperature con-
trol. This control approach also fails to tap into the energy savings
available if fan operation is adjusted to match reduced airflow
needs. A variable-speed drive will capture this opportunity (assum-
ing that zone loads actually vary) and is the most energy efficient
VAV option.
6.8.1.2 VAV Reheat or VAV Dual Duct. By sequencing reheat
or blending airstreams at each zone after throttling the zone’s cold
air supply via VAV control, full heating/cooling flexibility can be
achieved much more energy efficiently than with comparable con-
stant-volume systems. This approach can be applied to both interior
and perimeter spaces. The fan volume control options described
above can be used—with a preference for the use of a variable-
speed drive.
6.8.1.3 VAV with Independent Perimeter System. All-air
cooling and heating can be accomplished using a VAV system to
serve interior spaces in conjunction with a constant-volume perime-
ter system. The variable-volume system provides cooling (and only
cooling) year-round, taking care of variations in all zone internal
heat gains as well as building envelope solar gains. The perimeter
system uses an outdoor/indoor temperature-scheduled, con-
stant-volume air supply to offset envelope conduction/convection
gains or losses. The perimeter system requires no zone control
(except to improve operating economy) and no outdoor air compo-
130⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
nent since the VAV system takes care of each zone’s load variations
(except opaque envelope loads) and all outdoor air ventilation
requirements.
If a hydronic perimeter heating system is provided, the VAV
system provides cooling in all zones year-round, while the perime-
ter heating system offsets winter transmission heat losses (but not
summer transmission heat gains). Coordination between these two
delivery systems is important to overall energy efficiency.
6.8.1.4 VAV with Constant Zone Airflow Volume. VAV ter-
minal devices may contain fans to maintain minimum or constant
supply airflow to a particular zone while the volume of system pri-
mary air that is supplied to the zone is varied. Such terminals are
commonly referred to as fan-powered terminals. The airflow to the
zone is kept constant by recirculating return air—keeping the sum
of the variable primary air (to meet loads) and the recirculated air
substantially constant. This technique is particularly useful for
zones with large variations in internal loads, such as conference
rooms. It may also be combined with terminal reheat. Or return air
from the interior can be transferred to perimeter fan-powered boxes
to avoid terminal reheat. Fan-powered terminals can be used to
ensure good air circulation in occupied spaces during periods of
reduced cooling load.
6.8.1.5 VAV with Economizer Cycle. When the enthalpy
(total heat content) of the outdoor air is lower than that of the return
air, energy consumption for cooling can be reduced by taking in
more outdoor air than required for ventilation and relieving the
excess return air to the outdoors. Under favorable conditions, all of
the return can be relieved and replaced by outdoor air. This mode of
operation is called an air-side economizer cycle (see Section 9.3.7).
While this approach requires large outdoor air intake and relief/
exhaust components, it improves economy of operation except in
areas, such as the southeastern United States, where such favorable
enthalpy conditions occur so rarely that the additional first cost of
providing for economizer operation is not justified (Mutammara
and Hittle 1990).
6.8.1.6 Applications. VAV systems are easy to control, can be
highly energy efficient, allow fairly good zone control, are easily
adaptable to economizer cycles, and provide flexibility for zoning
changes. A potential drawback includes the possibility of poor ven-
tilation, resulting in the potential for unacceptable indoor air qual-
ity, particularly under low zone loads. VAV systems are suitable for
offices, classrooms, and many other applications and are currently
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐131
the system of choice for most commercial and institutional build-
ings despite the fact that humidity control under widely varying
latent loads can be difficult, as illustrated in Figure 6-3 and in
Appendix C.
Figure 6-3. VAV system—schematic and psychrometric chart.
132⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
6.8.2 VAV Design Considerations
6.8.2.1 Psychrometric Analysis. A typical arrangement of
components for a VAV system with separate perimeter heating is
shown schematically in Figure 6-3, with typical psychrometric per-
formance for maximum and partial loads and for summer and win-
ter operation. For cooling-only applications, air is delivered to a
space at a fixed supply temperature that (at design flow rate) can
offset the design space cooling load. The space thermostat reduces
the volume of supply air when the cooling load is less than the
design load. If some warm up is desired after system shutdown, a
heating coil may be installed and manually or automatically actu-
ated for warm up only. When system supply air is throttled while
outdoor air volume is kept constant, tempering of the outdoor air
may be necessary under cold winter ambient conditions. Equations
6-1 through 6-6 apply for fan gains, ceiling temperatures, and air
mixtures. Zone ductwork and variable-volume terminals must be
sized for the governing load factor, either sensible, latent, or venti-
lation loads.
The designer must determine the maximum system air volume
from either (1) coincident system (block) load or (2) block sensible
load plus all air requirements from governing latent or ventilation
loads that exceed the volume required in any zone to satisfy the sen-
sible load in that zone when the entire system reaches its peak sen-
sible load. Thus, if a system load peaks at 4:00 p.m. and an east
zone’s air requirement from sensible loads is less than the volume
required by its latent or ventilation loads at that time, the latter vol-
ume must be used for that zone and an appropriate temperature con-
trol strategy applied. Actively controlling for nonsensible dominant
loads is problematic, as discussed below.
If building operators set thermostats below the values used for
design calculations, more supply air will be required than the
amount determined by the block load. Under these conditions,
zones would experience a shortage of supply air if the system was
designed based upon block loads only. Such an occurrence is possi-
ble. Energy-efficient design practices suggest an indoor summer
design temperature of 78°F [25.6°C], and some occupants may find
that this setting provides marginal comfort, especially in the pres-
ence of high mean radiant temperature. Attempts by the building
operator to correct for such discomfort may involve resetting tem-
perature sensors below design conditions, leading to the above sce-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐133
nario. Designing to provide some flexibility in control, without
drastically oversizing systems, is advisable.
Whenever supply air volume is throttled at a given dew-point
condition, dehumidification capacity decreases. (This effect may be
offset somewhat if reduced airflow through the cooling coil results
in increased dehumidification due to increased coil-air contact.) The
effect of reducing air volume on dehumidification capacity is illus-
trated in Figure 6-3, where R1 and R4 represent zones with high and
low latent loads. Spaces with high latent loads must be carefully
examined on the psychrometric chart before the proper air volume
can be determined. Some designers prefer to design zones governed
by latent or ventilation loads as constant-volume zones because a
thermostat cannot respond to variations in either of those loads. This
strategy ensures a sufficient supply air volume under all conditions,
although the wisdom of mixing systems must be considered and the
tendency to employ reheat for constant volume control resisted.
As each zone peaks at a different time of day, it “borrows” the
extra air required to meet its peak load from off-peak zones. Such
sharing of air between off- and on-peak zones occurs only in true
VAV systems and represents a utilization of system diversity. Sys-
tems that dump excess supply air into a return air system or bypass
it to a return duct may be using zone VAV temperature control prin-
ciples, but their design supply air volume is the sum of the peaks
that is circulated on a constant-volume basis. Such systems do not
use smaller fans and main ducts than a constant-volume system and
miss out on opportunities for reduced energy use (a major advan-
tage of VAV systems); they should be considered obsolete.
Be sure to examine minimum air quantities in each zone and in
the system. First, check for adequate dehumidification (Equation 6-2)
and ventilation (Section 3.3.3). Second, check the increase in back
pressure resulting from terminal throttling and its effect on fans and
ducts and their need for static pressure control. Third, check for poten-
tial noise problems in terminal devices arising from throttling. If, at
minimum system volume, the increase in static pressure at the fan dis-
charge and at the last terminal device is not so large as to cause fan
instability, distribution imbalance, or excessive pressure drop in the
last terminal, volume regulation and/or system static pressure control
may not be necessary. Such a system would be “riding the fan curve,”
varying the delivered air volume with changing system static pressure.
Without fan speed control, however, most of the potential energy sav-
ings will be lost by just throttling airflow and riding the fan curve.
134⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
Distinguish between the minimum throttling ratio (ratio of
throttled flow to full flow) in any zone and that in the system. The
ratio can be as low as 0.25 in a zone with a peak of, for example,
3 cfm/ft2 [15 L/s per m2], without necessarily violating ventilation
criteria, while the system ratio might never go below 0.5. The lower
the system design static pressure, the smaller the duct network; the
higher the throttling ratio, the less need there is for system static
control. Static pressure controls can be used to maintain fan stabil-
ity and distribution balance, to reduce operating costs, and to stabi-
lize system sound generation characteristics.
Minimum ventilation air quantities can be maintained by
•
raising supply air temperatures on a system basis (although this
must be done with caution as it can lead to high humidity on
cool humid days, when sensible and latent loads are out of
sync),
•
raising supply air temperatures using reheat on a zone-by-zone
basis, and
•
providing auxiliary heat in a zone, independently of the air system.
Full-zone air circulation can be maintained by
•
individual zone recirculation (via terminal units) with blending
of varying amounts of supply air with room air or ceiling ple-
num air, and
•
ceiling induction unit recirculation (as above).
Oversized VAV terminals should be avoided. They tend to be
noisy because they must always be throttled. Low-frequency noise
(which is difficult to attenuate) can be replaced with high-frequency
noise (which is easier to attenuate) by installing a piece of perfo-
rated metal upstream of the terminal box, sized to reduce the full
flow pressure at the terminal by the amount needed to provide bet-
ter acoustics. The multiple holes cause low frequencies to be “end
reflected” and energy to be dissipated in forcing air through the
multihole orifice. Unfortunately, the following relationship applies:
(flow rate2) / (flow rate1) = (P2 / P1)0.5
(6-7)
This means that the orifice will exhibit a parabolic control func-
tion. In addition, airflow sensors do not provide adequate velocity
pressure signals at low flow conditions to permit accurate termi-
nal modulation.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐135
When radiation is provided for perimeter heating (see Section
6.8.1.3), size it to offset envelope transmission losses. Heat is sup-
plied by radiation in proportion to outdoor temperature. The VAV
system usually provides all outdoor air requirements for interior as
well as perimeter zones. If it is assumed that radiation exactly off-
sets transmission loss, interior loads will cause the VAV terminal to
remain open, providing ventilation requirements and air movement
for comfort and odor control. In reality, such an assumption is hard
to implement; thus, the VAV box and radiation control valve should
be sequenced so that the VAV box is at its cooling (and ventilation)
minimum before the radiation valve starts to open. The same effect
may be produced when a perimeter air system without outdoor air
is used to offset transmission loads.
The solid lines in Figure 6-3b represent average system condi-
tions, while the dotted lines represent individual zone conditions.
The psychrometric chart does not show variations in airflow; a drop
in room sensible load with no change in latent load appears as a
steeper internal sensible heat ratio (SHR) line (s-R1) due to the
reduced air volume. A typical winter cooling condition for a cold
climate is shown in Figure 6-3c. The moisture level is reduced due
to mixing of return air with low-dew-point outdoor air. Supply air
temperature at s is maintained by controlling the outdoor air damp-
ers and return air dampers to produce the mixed-air state m. Some
preheating may be needed to maintain the state, which would fur-
ther reduce the space relative humidity. Temperature is maintained
at each individual zone in the system by reducing zone airflow.
Again, relative humidity may rise as sensible loads are reduced.
All the preceding considerations apply when a separate
perimeter radiation system handles the perimeter transmission and
infiltration heating loads, while a common air system (serving
both interior and perimeter zones with the same temperature air)
handles cooling.
6.8.2.2 Envelope Isolation System. Some designers have
used a perimeter system to handle all conduction/convection loads
from the envelope, in effect thermally isolating the envelope from
the rest of the building (except for solar gains). Such a system
could be a hot-water radiation system or a separate air system
along the perimeter, although water would be preferred in cold
climates. The advent of improved-performance envelope assem-
blies, and particularly high-performance glazings, has generally
made such systems unnecessary.
136⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
6.8.2.3 Air Volume. Pay particular attention to evaluation of the
expected patterns of loads in a VAV system, as such patterns will
affect airflow volume. Likewise, carefully estimate loads for VAV
zones so that terminals are not regularly operating at low percent-
ages of design flow with the potential for reduced indoor air quality
that can come from such reduced flows. Selection of supply outlets
that can produce secondary air motion is desirable in VAV system
design. Proper design may require a smaller Δt or higher-perfor-
mance, aspirating-type outlets in order to enhance air movement.
A typical pressure distribution through the supply and return
air sections of a VAV system is illustrated in Figure 6-4. A basic
design goal is to size the supply and return fans along with the sup-
ply and return air distribution systems to maintain a slight positive
pressure in the building spaces. Since the positions of the zone con-
trol dampers in a VAV system are constantly changing, however,
one design combination cannot meet the pressure requirements at
all operating conditions. The best compromise is automatically
afforded by supply fan pressure control via a variable-frequency
drive (VFD), which produces an energy conservation advantage as
well. Reduction in capacity of the supply fan drops the pressure at
points A and B in Figure 6-4 in comparison to full-capacity opera-
tion of the fan. The result is that deviations from the desired zone
pressures are minimized.
Air distribution is very important in VAV systems, as supply air
volumes are continually changing. Give careful consideration to
distribution and to sound pressure levels at maximum and minimum
flow. If the combined sound pressure level of the terminal unit and

system.

diffuser at maximum flow is at least 3 decibels below the room
ambient sound pressure level, sound pressure level variations will
not be noticed. In some cases, this may require the careful design of
ductwork downstream of the VAV box to attenuate noise produced
by the box. The subject of local velocities as they might affect VAV
systems is covered in the “Space Air Diffusion” chapter in the
ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals.
6.8.2.4 Return versus Relief Fans. In VAV systems with an
economizer cycle, performance can sometimes be improved by
replacing the return air fan with a relief air fan (Avery 1984).
Figure 6-5 shows a typical economizer cycle. The return air fan
handles all the return air and exhausts the relief air from the build-
ing. Typical pressures are shown at various locations in the system.
Note that the return air damper has been sized for a 1.5 in. w.g.
[375 Pa] pressure drop, three times the pressure drop across the out-
door air damper. If this is not done, damper instability can occur,
and, since a 45 mph [20 m/s] wind causes a pressure of 1 in. w.g.
Figure 6-5. Typical VAV economizer cycle with return air fan.
138⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
[249 Pa], air may blow in the exhaust opening and out of the air
intake with some wind conditions and damper positions.
Sample relative pressure values for the various points noted in
Figure 6-5 are as follows:
(1) –0.25 in. w.g. [–62 Pa]; (2) –0.75 in. w.g. [–187 Pa]; (3) –1.0
in. w.g. [–249 Pa]; (4) –2.5 in. w.g. [–622 Pa]; (5) +2.5 in. w.g.
[+622 Pa]; (6) –0.25 in. w.g. [–62 Pa]; (7) +0.75 in. w.g. [+187
Pa]; (8) +0.25 in. w.g. [+62 Pa].
Fan power may be reduced by using the arrangement shown in
Figure 6-6. Here the pressure drop across the return air damper has
been reduced from 1.5 to 0.5 in. w.g. [375 to 124 Pa]. The work
required to move the supply air, however, is unchanged. Only the
relief air has to be pushed against the 1.5 in. w.g. [375 Pa] relief air
pressure drop, resulting in fan energy savings. The outputs from
flow-measuring stations in the outdoor air duct and the relief air
duct are fed into a comparator controller. Its output controls the
Figure 6-6. VAV economizer cycle with relief air fan and no return air
fan.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐139
relief air fan so that the flow of relief air at all times equals that of
the outdoor air. Note that it can be difficult to accurately measure
the relief and outdoor air volumes across the range of flows under
which they may operate, as it is hard to get a good control signal
under low airflow conditions. An allowance for building exhaust
and pressurization must also be considered in adjusting the relief
and outdoor air volumes.
Sample relative pressure values for the various points noted in
Figure 6-6 are as follows:
(1) –0.25 in. w.g. [–62 Pa]; (2) –0.75 in. w.g. [–187 Pa]; (3) –1.0
in. w.g. [–249 Pa]; (4) –0.25 in. w.g. [–62 Pa]; (5) +2.5 in. w.g.
[+622 Pa]; (6) –0.25 in. w.g. [–62 Pa]; (7) –0.75 in. w.g. [–187
Pa]; (8) +0.25 in. w.g. [+62 Pa].
The relief air damper closes whenever the economizer cycle is
not in use. Minimum outdoor air volume is maintained because
bathroom and other exhausts provide sufficient relief to prevent
overpressurizing the building. Advantages of the system in
Figure 6-6 are as follows (Avery 1984):
•
The return air damper is sized for the same pressure drop as
other dampers.
•
Total system pressure drop is reduced (20% in the example)
whenever the system is off the economizer cycle.
•
Wind effects are minimized.
•
There is no heat generated by a return air fan, thereby reducing
the load on the cooling coils.
•
Fan power limitations in Standard 90.1 may favor the use of a
relief versus a return fan.
6.8.2.5 Energy Savings. VAV systems have an inherent poten-
tial to provide flexible control of cooling with lower annual energy
consumption compared to other systems. The design characteristics
that make this possible are:
1.
The reduction in system air volume coincides with the sum of
the zone volume reductions. This permits direct savings in fan
energy (when using a VFD) with indirect savings in refrigera-
tion energy.
2.
When the system distribution layout includes all interzonal
variations (i.e., all exposures), the fan may be selected to han-
dle the block load flow only (the coincident zone peaks) rather
than for the sum of the zone peaks (as with a constant volume
system). As suggested in Section 6.8.2.1, however, this could
140⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
result in insufficient airflow if thermostats are set below the
design temperature.
6.8.2.6 Controls. Proper design calls for a VAV terminal to be
at its maximum setting when the zone under its control experiences
maximum (design) load. As the zone load decreases, the action of
the VAV controller reduces airflow. This, in turn, increases duct
pressure, which condition is transmitted to the central air-handler
control to produce a reduction in system airflow. This system air-
flow reduction is the major reason for energy savings available with
VAV systems compared to constant volume systems. Figure 5-6
(Chapter 5) illustrates fan energy variations with airflow for differ-
ent types of fan control. It is apparent that variable-speed fan con-
trol conserves the most energy and should be used where
appropriate. Such control is the norm in current VAV systems.
A means of ensuring minimum outdoor air delivery as total air-
flow is reduced may be provided at the central apparatus. A velocity
controller located in the outdoor air intake can ensure that dampers
are open sufficiently to provide the minimum outdoor airflow
desired. A less costly method is to schedule a variable minimum
position of the outdoor air damper from the duct static pressure sen-
sor, the fan control operator, or the velocity controller, all of which
react directly to system volume reduction. Field tests can best
establish the two outdoor air damper positions that achieve substan-
tially constant outdoor air intake during maximum and minimum
system airflow conditions. The outdoor air control damper can then
be proportionally scheduled between these two points. If an econo-
mizer cycle is used, the constant-airflow outdoor air controller can
be overridden by the mixing thermostat. Use of an outdoor air fan
has also proven successful as a means of ensuring adequate outdoor
air supply. Pressure-independent VAV boxes can maintain a mini-
mum airflow regardless of supply air setpoint.
Preheating or tempering of the minimum outdoor air supply
may be necessary during cold weather and low system airflow con-
ditions. Resetting supply air temperature for economy or for mini-
mum air motion may be accomplished by two means:
1.
All zone thermostat signals are fed through a discriminating
controller, which raises the supply air temperature as the last of
the variable-volume controllers starts to throttle, thus keeping
the zone with the highest cooling load at design temperature
with its variable-volume damper wide open. If, under this
mode of operation, any zone has a low enough load to be call-
ing for less than its minimum ventilation, such a zone can be
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐141
equipped to (a) sequence perimeter radiation or terminal
reheat, (b) recirculate with a zone fan unit, or (c) use a suitable
induction device when applicable. Methods (b) and (c), how-
ever, increase total air circulation but do not increase the out-
door air supply.
2.
The controller that senses a reduction in system volume may be
used to raise the supply air temperature to maintain maximum
flow as long as all zones can be satisfied. When that tempera-
ture has been raised to its highest tolerable setting and exces-
sive throttling still occurs, radiation temperature may be
scheduled upward so that only enough auxiliary heat is intro-
duced in the perimeter areas to keep VAV dampers at a desired
minimum open position. These procedures keep final zone
control in the hands of the VAV damper. The effect of resetting
supply air temperature on space relative humidity must be con-
sidered in any reset scheme.
Providing separate systems for indoor air quality control and
thermal control is an approach that has been suggested and occa-
sionally implemented. Each system focuses upon its defined role,
and compromise or conflict between the two roles and systems is
not required. See, for example, Dieckman et al. (2003).
For general information on controls, see Chapter 10. Appendix C
contains detailed design calculations for a VAV system.
6.9 REHEAT SYSTEMS
6.9.1 System Concepts
A reheat system is a modification of the constant-volume sin-
gle-zone system. As the word reheat implies, heat is applied (as a
secondary process) to cooled supply air. The heating medium may
be hot water, steam, or electricity.
A reheat system permits simple zone control for areas of
unequal loading. It can also provide simultaneous heating or cool-
ing of perimeter areas with different exposures, maintain very
close control of space humidity, and accomplish dehumidification
independently of sensible cooling, which other systems cannot do.
It offers the designer infinite zoning capability during design, and
zones can be readily revised during construction or occupancy if
zoning changes are made. Field changes to accommodate zoning
revisions during occupancy require only the addition of a heating
coil or terminal unit and a thermostat. The major disadvantage of
the reheat system is its high energy consumption and related
142⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
building code restrictions if not properly designed and controlled.
It also requires heating coils with piping or electrical supply for
every zone.
Reheat systems—when permitted—are used in hospitals, labo-
ratories, and office buildings; spaces with wide load variations or
high latent loads; and process or comfort applications where close
control of space conditions is required.
Terminal units are designed to permit heating of primary air or
secondary air that is induced from the conditioned space and are
located either under a window or in the overhead duct system. Con-
ditioned air is supplied from a central unit at a fixed cold-air tem-
perature designed to offset the maximum cooling load in any zone.
A zone thermostat calls for reheat as the cooling load in that zone
drops below design load.
Keep in mind that adding heat to cooled air to provide zone
temperature control is basically uneconomical. Reheat systems are
inherently energy wasteful and have no redeeming efficiency fea-
tures. Many energy codes, including Standard 90.1, severely restrict
their use; some exceptions, however, are detailed in the standard.
Although they can provide excellent control of conditions, try to
avoid the use of reheat systems.
Where a constant supply air volume is maintained, energy use
for reheat is maximized. Varying volume as a first step in control
delays the need to apply heat until a predetermined minimum air-
flow is reached; such a strategy reduces operating costs consider-
ably. Additional savings in operating costs may be accomplished by
resetting the cold air supply temperature upward as outdoor temper-
ature falls. Discriminating controls (see Section 9.3.3) accomplish
this automatically. There is no egregious energy penalty and, there-
fore, no objection to the use of reheat if it is accomplished through a
heat recovery system using heat rejected from the refrigeration
cycle or an internal heat source. This implementation of reheat,
however, still initially cools air more than necessary to meet
loads—resulting in a waste of refrigeration.
Figure 6-7a shows a schematic for a typical primary air reheat
system. Figure 6-7b depicts a reheat terminal unit. The correspond-
ing psychrometric chart is also shown (Figures 6-7c and 6-7d).
Solid lines indicate average system conditions at full load; dashed
lines pertain to individual zone (room) conditions. Under full-load
operation, space loads are picked up between s and R. Reheat is
added to zones with lower loads from prim to s2 or s3. A zone with
no latent load will maintain space condition R2, while zones with
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐143
higher than average latent loads could produce conditions such as
R3. Space humidities can be maintained at any value not lower than
that indicated by prim, which is adjusted to correspond to the low-
est desirable value of relative humidity in any zone.
Figure 6-7. Reheat system—schematics and psychrometric chart.
144⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
6.9.2 Special Design Considerations
Procedures for determining air volume requirements for a sin-
gle-duct reheat system are identical to those discussed in
Section 6.7 for single-zone systems. The basic difference between
constant-volume and variable-volume approaches is in the total air
volume required for the system. The air volume for a constant-vol-
ume system is normally determined by the sum of the individual
peak volumes required for each zone. Ensure that all zones have
sufficient reheat capacity at the block peak to maintain their desired
humidity criteria. In constant-volume reheat systems, select the
supply air temperature required for the zone with the highest cool-
ing load; any zones with less-than-design loads will operate on
reheat. Devote extra care to maximum cooling load zone calcula-
tions. At times it may be appropriate to disregard isolated high-load
areas, assuming that a slight temperature increase from design con-
ditions under peak loads in those areas may not be objectionable.
Low-velocity air systems require only a heating coil in the
ductwork to provide zone control—along with suitable balancing
dampers. For high velocity/pressure systems, a terminal reheat
device containing a means of flow balancing and noise attenuation
is generally necessary. A volume-regulating device in the terminal
is adjusted to provide the desired air volume. As the zone load falls,
the thermostat positions the heating valve to provide energy to off-
set the load change.
Reheat units may be located in ductwork or under windows.
Under windows is the preferred location in cold climates (design
conditions below 20°F [–6.7°C]) to eliminate downdrafts (unless
high-performance glazing is used). Primary air to the reheat unit is
fed through the floor or from column chases. Under-window reheat
units are usually provided with enclosures.
Induction-type reheat units (rarely used today) are usually
installed at the building perimeter under the windows (although over-
head installation is also possible). Routine maintenance is required to
keep filters clean, as induction ratios are affected by increased pres-
sure drop across the filter. Access must be provided to service com-
ponent parts. With low-temperature units, coil surfaces are in the
primary (not the secondary) recirculated airstream, and filters are not
usually provided. Units installed in high lint areas require routine
cleaning. These units require relatively high static pressures for
proper operation, which affects system pressures and, thus, energy
efficiency. The under-window induction-type reheat unit allows night
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐145
heating with the air system shut down. Low-temperature types offer
excellent control capability at reduced initial cost.
6.10 DUAL-DUCT SYSTEMS
6.10.1 System Concepts
6.10.1.1 System Basics. Dual-duct systems distribute air from
a central air handler to the conditioned spaces through two parallel
ducts. One duct carries cold air and the other warm air, thus provid-
ing air sources for both heating and cooling at all times. In each
conditioned zone, a mixing damper in a terminal box controlled by
a room thermostat mixes the warm and cold air in proper propor-
tions to satisfy the thermal load of the space. Return air is usually
handled in a conventional manner through a ducted or plenum
return system. Dual-duct systems usually maintain acceptable room
conditions across a wide range of zone loads.
Among the advantages of dual-duct systems are good control
of temperature and humidity, the ability to accommodate a variety
of zone loads, ease in adding zones or subdividing existing zones,
and adaptability to either constant- or variable-volume systems.
Disadvantages are relatively high energy consumption, substantial
space requirements to accommodate two sets of ducts running
throughout the building, the cost of the extensive ductwork, and the
need for a large number of terminal mixing boxes (which are
expensive and may require maintenance). Moreover, economizer
cycles are sometimes difficult to implement with dual-duct systems.
Dual-duct systems have typically been used where VAV sys-
tems were not considered appropriate; they were extensively used
in office buildings during the 1950s and 1960s. Experience has
shown that these systems produce good results when located in
moderately humid climates, where outdoor design conditions do
not exceed 78°F [25.6°C] wet bulb and 95°F [35°C] dry bulb, and
when minimum outdoor air in the system does not exceed 35% to
40% of total air. Recently, dual-duct systems have become less pop-
ular because of their high energy consumption (relative to other
options) and high first cost. The energy effect, however, can be mit-
igated by applying VAV control to reduce total supply air during
periods of reduced cooling and heating loads, as explained in Sec-
tion 6.10.1.4 and shown in Figure 6-11.
Figure 6-8 shows the simplest, least costly, and most compact
apparatus arrangement for dual-duct air conditioning. The return
fan shown may be eliminated on small installations if provisions are
146⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
made to relieve excess outdoor air from the conditioned spaces. The
use of relief air fans instead of return air fans is gaining increased
acceptance; they accomplish pressure relief with less energy use
because they handle smaller airflow volumes—exhaust air only
instead of all of the return air.
Figure 6-8. Single-fan dual-duct system with blow-through dehumidi-
fication—schematic and psychrometric chart.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐147
In summer, the cold air supply temperature should be kept just
low enough to meet the space cooling and dew-point requirements.
This is usually around 50°F to 55°F [10.0°C to 12.8°C] with the air
nearly saturated. In winter, air temperature is sometimes reset 5°F
to 10°F [2.8°C to 5.6°C] higher for economy of operation; if inter-
nal loads are small, outdoor air may be used for the cold duct sup-
ply, permitting shutdown of the chiller. Maintaining the cold air
during the heating season at 55°F to 60°F [12.8°C to 15.6°C] and
raising the warm air temperature as the outdoor temperature
decreases, however, permits better humidity control and better air
balancing between the hot and cold ducts (at the expense of
increased energy use). In summer, the warm air temperature is gov-
erned by the return air from the conditioned spaces. The hot duct
temperature will always be higher than the average return air tem-
perature, even though no heat is added by the heating coil, due to
the heat contributed by outdoor air, fan energy, and recessed light-
ing fixtures. In winter, the warm air temperature can be adjusted
based upon the outdoor temperature. Bear in mind that an energy
penalty results when the cold air temperature is lower than it needs
to be to satisfy the cooling requirement of the “warmest” zone or,
conversely, when the warm air temperature is higher than it needs to
be to satisfy the heating requirement of the “coldest” zone.
The solid lines in Figure 6-8b represent average system air con-
ditions, while specific zone conditions are shown by dashed lines.
Thus, while the system as a whole is at peak cooling with average
supply air at state s, yielding an average room condition R, a peak
zone with a closed warm supply duct would call for supply air at s1,
yielding a room condition R1, and a conference room with full
occupancy and no lights might call for s2 and yield R2. With all
room thermostats set at 76°F [24.4°C], the supply air temperature to
various zones can lie anywhere between s1 and s2, while room con-
ditions are maintained at 76°F [24.4°C] dry-bulb temperature but at
a variety of humidity conditions between states R1 and R2.
Figure 6-8c shows average winter conditions.
Figures 6-8b and 6-8c illustrate that a dual-duct system main-
tains accurate temperature control in all zones year-round through
the full range of each zone’s internal sensible heat loads. Although
room humidities may increase moderately under normal load varia-
tions, only under unusual circumstances will they increase exces-
sively. When even this is not permissible, investigate the dual-duct
variations described in the following two sections.
148⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
Tail-end ducts with small airflow quantities are much more
influenced by duct transmission gains than large trunks and may be
substantially different in temperature (particularly if uninsulated)
from the supply air temperature leaving the central air handler.
While the mixing boxes automatically adjust for the changed duct
temperatures, ascertain that such temperatures are sufficient to sat-
isfy extreme zone heating and cooling demands.
6.10.1.2 Two-Fan System. When humidity must be kept below
some specified value under all operating conditions, and psychro-
metric analysis shows that the system arrangement shown in
Figure 6-8 cannot accomplish this, consider the two-fan
blow-through cycle and the single-fan reheat cycle as options.
The two-fan blow-through system shown in Figure 6-9 is eco-
nomical to operate and permits close control of room humidity in
summer, when less than half the total air is handled by the warm
duct. Each of the two supply fans is sized to handle approximately
half the total system airflow. The bypass connections on the
upstream and downstream sides of the supply fans do not require
any flow control. Airflow through the bypass will always be deter-
mined by the thermal requirements of the conditioned spaces and
by the temperatures maintained in the cold and warm ducts. Appli-
cation of reheat to the warm duct air may be necessary to depress
the relative humidity in the conditioned spaces during part-load
operation coincident with high outdoor dew-point temperatures.
Figure 6-9. Dual-duct two-fan blow-through cycle.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐149
Another limitation of this cycle is the possibility of not meeting
ventilating requirements in lightly loaded zones that are predomi-
nantly fed by the warm duct. Keep in mind, however, that with this
type of all-air system, return air from full-load zones and from
low-load zones is continuously mixed in the fan plenum. Since the
same air never returns to the same zone and all the air to each zone
is constantly mixed with air from all zones, no odor accumulation
or air quality discomfort will likely occur, even if the low-load zone
receives only used air from the rest of the building. Having said
this, remember that HVAC designs must meet the requirements of
codes and standards relative to outdoor air supply. Consistently
underventilating a space is bad practice.
An alternative arrangement to the cycle shown in Figure 6-9 is
obtained if the bypass connection on the discharge side of the sup-
ply fan is omitted and if both supply fans are sized to handle
approximately 100% of total system air. This arrangement elimi-
nates the possibility of excessive air stratification in the cold and
warm chambers.
Disadvantages of the two-fan arrangement are
•
increased supply fan power requirements,
•
increased complexity of controls due to the need to control
static pressures in the duct systems, and
•
increased cost of equipment rooms.
6.10.1.3 Single-Fan, Dual-Duct Reheat System. Figure 6-10
shows an arrangement that permits high-limit control of relative
humidities in the conditioned spaces through the entire range of
operation. In this cycle, all the mixed air is cooled and dehumidified
Figure 6-10. Single-fan dual-duct draw-through cycle with hot deck
reheat.
150⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
first, then divided into cold and hot decks, with reheat in the latter.
Because of the continuous demand for reheat, the operating cost of
this arrangement is high. Also, additional refrigeration must be pro-
vided in most installations to treat the air bypassed to the warm-air
duct under conditions of maximum loading.
Functionally, this cycle is equivalent to a conventional reheat
system (Figure 6-7b). The only difference is that, instead of reheat-
ing air at a number of stations close to points of distribution, the
reheat is applied centrally at one point. All operational and cost
penalties of conventional reheat systems apply to this cycle.
According to Standard 90.1, this cycle should be used only when
reheat energy is obtained from the refrigeration apparatus by
hot-gas rejection or by another method of heat recovery or reclaim.
While this avoids most of the economic penalty involved with the
purchase of energy for reheating, the economic penalty for the
unnecessary refrigeration that leads to a need for reheating remains
the same.
6.10.1.4 Dual-Duct, VAV Cycle. The preceding sections refer
to dual-duct systems that handle a constant volume of air in all
zones at all operating conditions. The dual-duct VAV system
accomplishes zone temperature control by blending cold and warm
air subsequent to volume reduction of the total supply air to each
zone (Figure 6-11). At maximum cooling (when zone cooling gov-
erns), the room supply temperature and air quantity requirements
Figure 6-11.VAV dual-duct or VAV terminal reheat system.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐151
are identical to those of the constant-volume system; the volume
regulators deliver maximum volume and the cold port is wide open.
As the cooling load is reduced, a volume regulator reduces supply
volume to the minimum acceptable value (see Section 6.8.2.1). On
further decrease, the warm-air port begins to open as the cold air is
decreased. Minimum airflow volume is maintained below this level
of cooling load and during the entire heating cycle. As an option, air
volume from the warm-air duct may be increased as the heating
requirement increases. Under this option, the warm duct tempera-
ture may be lowered to facilitate mixing with room air and
improved room air circulation.
This system arrangement enjoys all the advantages of the sin-
gle-duct VAV system and is superior to the conventional VAV sys-
tem at the expense of higher energy consumption. It consumes
much less energy and has lower operating costs, however, than con-
stant-volume, single-path, terminal reheat systems. In most modern
buildings, the need for additional space for ductwork will typically
be a major impediment to implementation.
The psychrometric chart of Figure 6-8 also applies to
dual-duct VAV systems. VAV tends to shift the overall system pro-
cess lines slightly, however, because a fixed airflow raises the
mixed-air temperature (state m) with reduced system airflow
under any cooling load. Smaller air supply volumes in off-peak
zones, whose loads are met with reduced cold air instead of a
higher temperature blend of warm and cold air, tend to lower the
supply temperature to such zones, thereby lowering the average
system supply temperature and humidity.
6.10.2 Design Considerations
6.10.2.1 Overall Analysis. Equations 6-1 through 6-6 in Sec-
tion 6.6 apply to all dual-path systems, which include dual-duct and
multizone systems (see Section 6.11). Peak zone air supply require-
ments are complicated by the fact that mixing dampers of any kind
always exhibit some leakage through closed portions. The leakage
ratio, expressed as a fraction of the total air handled by the damper,
is a function of the system static pressure and the quality of the
damper closure mechanism and seals. For better-quality mixing
boxes, it will vary from 0.03 to 0.07; for field-constructed damper
assemblies (common in low-pressure systems) and multizone mix-
ing plenum assemblies, however, it can vary from 0.10 to 0.20 (a
substantial value).
152⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
In any dual-path system, if the latent load in any zone peaks
simultaneously with the system peak, some form of external or
internal reheat may be supplied to that zone without affecting
zone or system design air volume. If zone overcooling, however,
is avoided instead by admission of warm duct air, both zone and
system volumes will be increased. If the SHR slope is steep,
reheat applied at the zone is more desirable since it does not affect
air volumes.
If a rational (rather than an arbitrary) solution for the summer
warm duct temperature is desired, system supply volume must be
obtained by trial and error. In this manner, this temperature may be
optimized for minimum energy consumption by using only heat
from fans, duct transmission, and ceiling plenums. Heat need not be
added from the heating coil at peak summer conditions unless
required by some particular humidity control situation.
6.10.2.2 Duct Sizing. Warm air duct sizes in dual-duct systems
are seldom derived from consideration of the warm air require-
ments under winter peak. Maximum flow in the warm duct will
ordinarily occur during light summer loads or during intermediate
season operation while warm duct air temperatures are low. For this
reason, warm duct sizes are usually fixed as a certain percentage of
cold air duct size, as shown in Table 6-2.
Cold duct connections to each mixing box must be sized for the
peak volume of each zone. Cold duct branches serving a number of

zone mixing boxes that have little or no diversity between them
(i.e., those having the same orientation with identical lighting loads
and solar conditions) should be sized for the sum of the peaks of
each zone. Trunks, mains, or branches that serve either multiple
exposures or zones with appreciable diversity (i.e., noncoincident
peaks) should be sized according to Table 6-2, column 2. This will
give a somewhat larger area than would be obtained by a detailed
study requiring analysis of several operating conditions—although
undertaking such an analysis may be reasonable if obtained from
“what-if” computer simulations.
In VAV dual-duct systems, warm air is not used to neutralize
cold air at initial partial loads because cold air volume is reduced
first. Therefore, oversizing of warm ducts is not necessary pro-
vided that the terminal units accurately control minimum airflow
at varying system pressures. Table 6-2 does not apply to vari-
able-volume systems.
In dual-duct systems where volume control is accomplished at
terminal points, duct sizing becomes less critical than for other sys-
tems, and extreme precision is superfluous. Cold ducts may be
sized by the equal friction, static regain, or T-method, or a combina-
tion of all three. Volume regulators in mixing units will absorb any
pressure imbalance caused by the initial design, part-load opera-
tion, or future changes in load distribution, and they will produce a
mechanically stable system under normal operating conditions
regardless of the duct-sizing method used, provided the static pres-
sure needed by the longest duct is estimated correctly to establish
the fan power requirements.
As pointed out previously, maximum flow through the warm
duct usually occurs during intermediate season operation if low
temperatures are maintained in the warm portion, and warm duct
sizes are usually determined as a ratio of cold duct sizes
(Table 6-2). Some reduction in air distribution costs and space
requirements, however, can be achieved if the intermediate season
warm duct temperature is elevated sufficiently to reduce the warm
air demand at that time to be equal to, or less than, that required for
winter heating.
6.10.2.3 Minimum Outdoor Air Control. In systems using
constant-volume terminal units at all outlets, the fan capacity and
static pressures on the fan itself remain fairly constant, and fixed
minimum outdoor air dampers can ensure adequate ventilation.
Where static pressure on the fan suction of a VAV system varies,
however, it is important that the minimum outdoor air quantity be
154⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
controlled to maintain ventilation requirements. To do this, instru-
mentation to measure the velocity pressure or the flow through the
minimum outdoor air section can be installed. The instrumentation
regulates the volume control on the return air fan to cause the
proper amount of air to be drawn in through the minimum outdoor
air connection. Use of an outdoor air fan is another option.
6.10.3 Components
Two basic types of dual-duct mixing units are used: (1)
under-window units, which are limited in size, capacity, architec-
tural adaptability, and acoustical treatment, and (2) units designed
for ceiling or remote-location installation, which are usually con-
cealed or isolated from the conditioned space. Options for appear-
ance, space demands, and acoustical treatment are, therefore,
flexible. Capacities are generally from 100 to 4000 cfm [50 to
1890 L/s], although units up to 10,000 cfm [4700 L/s] may be
considered. Larger capacities may justify separate air-condition-
ing systems.
Terminal units appropriate for dual-duct systems are pre-
sented in the “All-Air Systems” chapter in the ASHRAE Hand-
book—HVAC Systems and Equipment. Terminal units, particularly
those with capacities of more than 1000 cfm [470 L/s], frequently
generate sufficient internal noise to require the installation of
downstream attenuators or duct lining. Sound power spectra
showing noise generation for a range of unit sizes at various air
deliveries and inlet static pressures are available from many man-
ufacturers. The required attenuation can readily be determined by
the procedures outlined in the “Sound and Vibration Control”
chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications. When
units are installed within the occupied space with no intervening
sound barrier, noise will be radiated directly from the terminal
unit casing into the room. The amount of noise will approximate
that emitted from the discharge. In such situations the sound from
both sources should be considered when determining the resultant
room sound pressure levels.
6.11 MULTIZONE SYSTEMS
6.11.1 System Description
The term multizone refers to a specific type of HVAC system
and is not meant to suggest any system with more than one zone. In
a multizone system, the requirements of the different zones of a
building are met by mixing cold air and warm air using dampers at
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐155
the central air-handling unit in response to zone thermostats. The
mixed conditioned air is distributed to specific zones throughout a
building by a system of multiple single-zone ducts. Thus, the distri-
bution system downstream of the air handler is a collection of zone-
dedicated duct systems. Return air is usually handled in a conven-
tional manner by intermingling the return air from all zones. The
two-fan cycle (Figure 6-9) has had little application in multizone
system design, probably as a result of the higher first cost with
smaller distribution systems, the lack of adaptability to packaged
equipment components, and the ability of the basic system to pro-
vide reasonable humidity control.
Advantages of the multizone system are good temperature con-
trol, the fact that ducts are the only system components (other than
diffusers) outside the mechanical room, and ease of control. Disad-
vantages include the need for many individual ducts, which limits
the number of zones, high energy consumption, inferior tempera-
ture control of the hot deck, and difficulty in implementing an econ-
omizer cycle. Multizone systems have been applied to small- or
medium-sized commercial buildings as well as to larger buildings
with relatively few zones.
The multizone system is conceptually similar to the dual-duct
system in all respects except for lack of flexibility over time and the
differences described in this section. It can provide a small building
with some of the advantages of dual-duct systems at lower first cost
with a wide variety of packaged equipment. Most packaged
air-handling units, however, lack the sophisticated control for com-
fort and operating economy that can be built into dual-duct systems.
The most common cycles used for multizone systems are shown in
Figures 6-8 and 6-10.
VAV may be applied to multizone systems in a manner similar
to that described in Section 6.8.1.2, with packaged or built-up sys-
tems having the necessary zone volume regulation and fan controls.
It is seldom applied in this manner, however, for entire distribution
systems except for television studios and other noise-critical appli-
cations. More often, a few select rooms in a zone may incorporate
VAV terminal devices when off-peak requirements permit this
approach and air balance considerations indicate there will be no
problems from omission of fan control or static pressure regulation.
Air volume and refrigeration capacities are treated the same as
those described in Section 6.8. The air volume may be somewhat
higher as a result of greater damper leakage.
156⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
6.11.2 Special Design Considerations
6.11.2.1 Single-Fan, Blow-Through Cycle. Multizone mixing
dampers are generally distributed horizontally along the hot and
cold deck discharge plenum of the air handler. These dampers are
analogous to the mixing boxes in a dual-duct system—except that
zone control occurs at the central air handler instead of at the zone
itself. The psychrometric analysis is identical to that shown in Fig-
ure 6-8b with two exceptions:
1.
The supply air blending occurs along line cc-sf for summer
instead of c-w and along line sf-hc for winter instead of c-w.
2.
The duct temperature rise occurs along each zone duct instead
of in the cold duct and warm duct.
6.11.2.2 Single-Fan, Draw-Through Cycle with Hot Deck
Reheat. The cycle shown in Figure 6-10 is used more frequently in
multizone than in dual-duct systems, mostly with packaged rooftop
units (Section 6.12) employing hot-gas reheat for intermediate sea-
son fuel energy reduction, supplemented with steam, hydronic,
direct electric, or indirect fuel-fired heat exchangers. Supplemental
heat is employed when the hot-gas reheat is inadequate (above 40°F
to 45°F [4.4°C to 7.2°C] ambient) and below these ambient condi-
tions when the refrigeration apparatus is normally shut down in
favor of economizer outdoor air cooling cycles.
6.11.3 Zone Dampers
Potential problems with zone volume variation tend to increase
with increasing variances in zone sizes, distribution complexity, and
distribution system pressure, just as with dual-duct systems. Exam-
ine these aspects to determine the need for individual zone volume
regulation and/or static pressure control, usually required when
zone volume differences exceed a ratio of 2:1.
Normal-quality dampers (whether field or factory manufac-
tured) for built-up or packaged units have leakage factors as high as
0.10 to 0.20, especially if maintenance is poor. The effect of this
leakage on supply air temperatures and volumes is appreciable and
must be seriously considered from a practical design standpoint. It
is possible to specify dampers fabricated for 0.03 to 0.05 leakage
factor; these are available for built-up equipment at an additional
cost from some packaged unit manufacturers and from control
damper manufacturers.

6.12 SIMPLE ROOFTOP SYSTEMS
Although rooftop systems can span the range of system types
and capacities, most rooftop systems are small- to medium-sized
systems in which the bulk of the refrigeration machinery is located
on the roof. These usually have reciprocating, scroll, or rotary com-
pressors with air-cooled condensers. They are usually applied to
low-rise buildings, such as small office buildings or shopping malls.
In a unitary system all components of the system, including the air
handlers, are located on the roof. In a split system the compressor
and condenser are located on the roof (or on the ground adjacent to
the building), while the evaporator(s) and air handler(s) are located
inside the building. During design, consider that unitary systems
require relatively large roof penetrations for air ducts, while split
systems require only small penetrations for the refrigerant piping,
unless outdoor air intakes and reliefs/exhausts are also ducted
through the roof.
Sophisticated rooftop systems may use single-zone, multi-
zone, or VAV arrangements. Analytical techniques for these
arrangements are covered in earlier sections of this chapter. Small,
simple rooftop systems generally consist of only a single unit each
of compressor, condenser, evaporator, and air handler, although
more than one air handler is sometimes used with split systems.
Larger single-zone, multizone, and VAV systems may have one or
more of these components, depending upon tonnage, space limita-
tions, and other design criteria.
Reasons for the popularity of rooftop systems include:
•
First costs are relatively low.
•
They are easy to install.
•
Machinery rooms are eliminated, resulting in considerable
first-cost savings.
•
Placing equipment on a roof does not reduce the rentable floor
area, as is the case with equipment located inside the building
enclosure.
•
Complete, prepackaged units with system performance guaran-
teed by the manufacturer are available. They relieve the
designer of the need to match components in order to design a
complete system, and contractors can order them from a cata-
log. Some come skid-mounted for quick installation.
•
Small tenants can each own and operate a separate unit, reliev-
ing the landlord of the need to service and pay for the operation
158⏐ ALL-AIR HVAC SYSTEMS
of the equipment. While the COP of small units is lower than
that of large centrifugal units, each small unit is operated only
as much as its owner requires. The total energy use of a number
of rooftop units may, therefore, be smaller than that of a large
central unit that must run whenever anybody in the building
requires space conditioning.
Frequently, rooftop units are used for small jobs with tight bud-
gets. Avoid the common pitfalls connected with these situations,
such as:
•
Rooftop units without return or relief air fans may encounter
problems meeting building code exhaust air requirements
under fire conditions.
•
Direct-expansion coils in larger capacity rooftop units are usu-
ally provided in four rows, with an SHR of around 0.65 to 0.75.
Conventional comfort cooling applications (not high-occu-
pancy spaces) typically involve an SHR of 0.75 to 0.85. The
designer must be careful to ensure a match between space load
sensible/latent relationships and the capability of the selected
equipment. Selecting oversized equipment to obtain capacity is
not a desirable solution.
•
Packaged equipment using direct-expansion cooling coils and
hot gas, electric, or indirect-fuel-fired hot deck heat exchangers
generally employs step controls for hot and cold deck capacity.
This substantially limits the quality of temperature and humid-
ity control unless specific control provisions are employed to
avoid this.
•
Air intakes should be placed as far away from air exhausts and
plumbing vents as possible, which may be difficult to do when
several rooftop units are installed on a relatively small roof.
•
Failure to install access walkways to rooftop units may result in
roof damage and resultant water leaks into the space below.
•
Water coils inside rooftop units must be protected from freez-
ing conditions.
•
Direct-expansion refrigeration equipment cycles on and off
during part-load operation, which can cause swings in space
humidity without proper control. The DX cooling coil retains
moisture removed from the air. When the refrigeration cycles
off, the moisture is re-entrained into the airstream, passing over
the cooling coil.

7.1 INTRODUCTION
Air-and-water systems condition spaces by distributing both
conditioned air and water to terminal units installed in the spaces.
The air and water are cooled and/or heated in a central mechanical
equipment room. The air supplied is termed primary air to distin-
guish it from recirculated (or secondary) room air.
Air-and-water systems that have been used in buildings of vari-
ous types are presented below. Not all of these systems are equally
valid in the context of a given project. Not all of these systems see
equal use in today’s design environment. They are presented, how-
ever, to provide a sense of the possibilities and constraints inherent
in the use of an air-and-water HVAC system.
Familiarity with the information on air-and-water systems pre-
sented in the “In-Room Terminal Systems” chapter of the ASHRAE
Handbook—HVAC Systems and Equipment is assumed in this man-
ual. Fundamental material from that resource is generally not
repeated here.
7.2 APPLICATIONS
7.2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages
Because of the greater specific heat and the much greater den-
sity of water compared to air, the cross-sectional area of piping is
much smaller than that of ductwork to provide the same cooling (or
heating) capacity. Because a large part of the space heating/cooling
load is handled by the water part of this type of system, the overall
duct distribution requirements in an air-and-water system are con-
siderably smaller than in an all-air system—which saves building
space. If the system is designed so that the primary air supply is
equal to the ventilation requirement or to balance exhaust require-

AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
162⏐ AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
ments, a return air system can be eliminated. The air-handling sys-
tem is smaller than that for an all-air system, yet positive ventilation
is ensured. Numerous zones can be individually controlled and their
cooling or heating demands satisfied independently and simulta-
neously. When appropriate to do so (as during unoccupied hours),
space heating can be provided by operating only the water side of
the system—without operating the central air system. When all pri-
mary air is taken from outdoors, cross-contamination between
rooms can be reasonably controlled.
Design for intermediate season operation is critical.
Changeover operation (between seasons) can be difficult and
requires a knowledgeable staff. Controls are more complicated than
for all-air systems, and humidity cannot be tightly controlled.
Induction and fan-coil terminal units require frequent in-space
maintenance.
7.2.2 Suitability to Building Types
Air-and-water systems are used primarily for perimeter build-
ing spaces with high sensible loads and where close control of
humidity is not a primary criterion. These systems work well in
office buildings, hospitals, schools, apartment buildings, and other
buildings where their capabilities can meet the project design intent
and criteria. In most climates, these systems are designed to provide
(1) all of the required heating and cooling needs for perimeter
spaces and (2) simultaneous heating and cooling in different spaces
during intermediate seasons.
7.3 SYSTEM CONCEPTS
An air-and-water system includes central air-conditioning
equipment, duct and water distribution systems, and room terminals.
The latter can be induction units, fan-coil units, or conventional sup-
ply air outlets combined with radiant panels. Usually, the primary air
system is constant volume. It provides all of the ventilation air and
generally covers some of the space latent cooling and some of the
space sensible cooling/heating. The water system may be a two-,
three-, or four-pipe arrangement and provides the majority of the
sensible cooling/heating and latent cooling (with the exception of
radiant panel systems, which do no latent cooling). These three
water distribution arrangements are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
In a typical air-and-water system, primary air is cooled by
chilled water produced by a chiller (although in smaller systems a
direct expansion cooling coil may be used). The room terminal
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐163
units are supplied by a water system connected to a chiller and a
boiler. The primary air system may contain an optional reheat coil.
Primary air is either all outdoor air or, if a return air system is pro-
vided, a mixture of outdoor and return air. The percentage of return
air is always small. Thus, where freezing temperatures are encoun-
tered, a preheater is required at the central air handler. Central sys-
tem filters should be of higher efficiency than in an all-air system to
compensate for reduced dilution of space contaminants as a result
of minimal air-side flow rates.
When individual zones are large, water (terminal) units are
often not located within the conditioned space but some distance
away, and their output air is conveyed to room supply terminals
through ductwork.
One system arrangement involves the use of individual termi-
nal units in each zone to provide air conditioning. In this approach,
units are installed around the perimeter of a building—one per
room for small rooms, more than one when needed for larger
rooms. The units are complete with casing, fans, water coil, filter,
and fan motor. An opening in the back or bottom of the unit can be
connected to an outdoor air intake. A grille-covered opening in the
front of the unit permits room (return) air to be drawn in. The coils
in the units are supplied with chilled water from a refrigeration
plant in the summer and in the winter with hot water from a hot
water heater or heat exchanger. Each room (zone) features individ-
ual temperature control. Relative humidity, however, depends upon
the room temperature, the length of time that the unit operates to
maintain the temperature, and the chilled-water temperature. To
provide proper control of relative humidity, a separate heating coil
is sometimes included so that dehumidification and reheat can be
accomplished. This requires the use of a four-pipe water system.
In an alternative arrangement, horizontal fan-coil units are sus-
pended in each zone. The fan-coils are furnished with chilled water
in summer and hot water in winter. The ceiling of a corridor is
furred down to form an insulated plenum in which conditioned
(cooled and dehumidified) outdoor air is circulated. This air pro-
vides ventilation and dehumidification capability. The room termi-
nal units draw in some air from the corridor plenum, mix it with
return air from the room, further condition it, and discharge the con-
ditioned mixture into the room.
Radiant panels for heating and cooling can also be applied to
air-and-water systems. They are compatible with two-, three-, and
four-pipe distribution arrangements. These panels are discussed in
164⏐ AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
the “Panel Heating and Cooling” chapter in the ASHRAE Hand-
book—HVAC Systems and Equipment.
The controls in air-and-water systems are usually arranged so
that, under design cooling loads, the primary air is supplied at lower
than room temperature and chilled water is circulated through the ter-
minal unit water coils. In transitional months, the primary air is
reheated and chilled water is still circulated through the water coils.
As the outdoor temperature decreases further, the warm (reheated)
primary air is switched to cold air, and the chilled water is switched
to hot water. This last transition between chilled- and hot-water sup-
ply is called the system changeover point. The changeover is not the
same for all facades (orientations) of a building, requiring careful
system design and zoning. Appropriate changeover is critical to occu-
pant comfort in a two-pipe distribution arrangement; changeover is
more forgiving in a three- or four-pipe system, where chilled and hot
water can both be made available during transition.
7.4 PRIMARY AIR SYSTEMS
Figure 7-1 shows the primary air system serving a two-pipe
distribution with induction terminal units. Such air systems are
comparable to the single-zone systems discussed in Section 6.7. If a
specific humidity ratio is to be maintained in winter, a humidifier
must be installed. An air-water induction unit is shown in
Figure 7-2 and a fan-coil unit is shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-1. Primary air system.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐165
The quantity of primary air for each zone is determined by the
•
ventilation requirement,
•
sensible cooling requirement at maximum cooling load—this
equals the room sensible cooling load less the sensible capacity
of the room (water) cooling coil, and
Figure 7-2. Air-and-water induction unit.
Figure 7-3. Air-and-water fan-coil unit.
166⏐ AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
•
maximum sensible cooling requirement on changeover to the
winter cycle when chilled water is no longer circulated through
the coils.
The primary supply air is typically dehumidified to “neutral-
ize” outdoor air latent loads, while also contributing to space latent
load control. A moisture content target for the supply air can be
estimated from
Wpa = Wr – (ql – qt) / (F Qp) ,
(7-1)
where
Wpa = humidity ratio of primary air, lb water/lb dry air [g/kg];
Wr
= maximum desired humidity ratio in zone, lb water/lb dry
air [g/kg];
ql
= room latent load, Btu/h [W];
qt
= terminal unit latent cooling capacity, Btu/h [W];
Qp
= primary air rate, cfm [L/s]; and
F
= 4840 [3.0].
To provide substantial primary air latent capacity, the air leav-
ing the cooling coil must generally be 50°F to 55°F [10.0°C to
12.8°C] and close to saturation, which requires deep coils and a rea-
sonably low chilled-water temperature. Reheat coils are required
for two-pipe systems to prevent overcooling of spaces under low
load conditions.
The psychrometric behavior of an air-and-water induction sys-
tem is shown in Figure 7-4 (summer peak) and Figure 7-5 (winter
peak). The figures illustrate the operation of a system where, in
summer, all the latent cooling and part of the sensible cooling are
performed by the primary air, while the water coil provides addi-
tional sensible cooling. During winter, preheated primary air is
shown to be humidified, while the water coil performs all heating.
Other operating strategies can be employed, wherein the primary
air essentially handles only ventilation loads. These patterns are
also valid for systems in which primary air is supplied to a fan-coil
unit through a directly connected air supply.
7.5 WATER-SIDE SYSTEMS
All-water systems are discussed in detail in Chapter 8; refer to
that chapter for assistance in designing the water side of an
air-and-water system.
Individual room temperature is controlled by varying the
capacity of the terminal coil by either regulating the water flowing

Figure 7-5. Induction system psychrometric chart at winter peak.
168⏐ AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
through the coil or the flow of air passing over it. During winter, the
cooling coil may be converted to a heating coil (with a two-pipe
system) or a separate heating coil may be provided (with a three- or
four-pipe system). The required coil cooling capacity is the room
sensible load reduced by the sensible cooling capacity of the pri-
mary air. Most air-and-water systems are designed to deliver cool
primary air throughout the year. The heating capacity of the coil
must therefore be designed to handle the room’s heating load plus
the primary air cooling effect. Select the coils conservatively to
overcome any imbalances in the water system.
7.5.1 Effect of Pump Curves on System Performance
The key variables defining the performance of a pump/piping
system are the pressure rise provided by the pump (to counteract
pressure drop in the piping) and the water flow rate. The relation-
ship between pump and piping determines the balance point where
the system operation satisfies both. Typical performance curves for
centrifugal pumps are shown in Figure 7-6 for a family of pumps
operating at 1750 rpm. At low flow rates, the curves (which show
the relationship between flow and head) are fairly flat; at high flow
rates, the curves show a marked decrease in available head with
increasing flow rates. The magnitude of the pressure rise provided
by a pump is predominantly a function of the tip speed of the impel-
ler, which is reflected in the higher heads available with larger
Figure 7-6. Performance of three pumps with different impeller diame-
ters operating at 1750 rpm.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐169
diameter impellers or higher speed pumps. If the pressure provided
by a pump of the largest diameter available is too low, choose a
pump that operates at a higher speed, e.g., 3500 rpm.
For straight pipe, friction (head) loss is proportional to the
square of the flow velocity (and, thus, the square of the flow rate):
head loss = (f) (L/D) (V2/2g)
(7-2)
where
head loss is in feet (m)
f = dimensionless friction factor (see the chapter on fluid flow in
the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals)
L = length of pipe, ft [m]
D = internal pipe diameter, ft [m]
V = flow velocity, ft/s [m/s]
g = acceleration of gravity, 32.2 ft/s2 [9.806 m/s2]
For fittings, such as elbows and tees, the friction loss is propor-
tional to the square of the flow rate, as evidenced by the expression
of fitting head loss as a certain number of velocity heads (V2/2g).
The performance of a water distribution system is, thus, a combina-
tion of pump characteristics, such as shown in Figure 7-6, and a
squared relationship for the piping network.
A further consideration is how the pump/piping system behaves
over a range of demands under different methods of control. In the
two two-pipe networks shown in Figure 7-7, the coils in Figure 7-7a
Figure 7-7. Water flow networks.
170⏐ AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
are controlled by three-way valves, while in Figure 7-7b they are
controlled by two-way valves. The intent of three-way valves is to
maintain a somewhat constant pressure drop across the coil-valve
combination, while with two-way valves the pressure drop is
increased in order to reduce the flow rate. The network shown in
Figure 7-7a is “direct return,” which has the drawback of a higher
pressure difference across the valves and coils closest to the pump.
A more balanced pressure difference occurs in a “reverse-return”
system, shown in Figure 7-7b, where the return starts at the nearest
coil and proceeds to the farther ones before returning the total flow
to the pump. This also produces a more self-balancing system rela-
tive to water flows.
The relief valve at the end of the flow path in Figure 7-7b
allows a low flow rate through the system and the pump if all the
control valves close off and the pump discharge pressure rises. An
operating characteristic of the two-way valve system is that, when
the coils experience a low-flow-rate demand, the pressure differ-
ence across the flow control valve rises. The valves adjust to near
their fully closed positions, where small changes in their stem posi-
tions can change the flow rate appreciably—bringing with this con-
dition the danger of valve “hunting.”
The combination of pump characteristics with those of a piping
network under some form of flow control defines the system behav-
ior. Figure 7-8 shows the head flow curve of one of the pumps (the
one with an 11 in. [280 mm] impeller) from Figure 7-6. Pump effi-
ciency and required pump power as functions of flow rate are also
supplied. Superimposed on the pump characteristic are several pip-
ing network characteristics with their expected parabolic shapes.
The lowest piping curve might represent the three-way valve net-
work of Figure 7-7a or the two-way valve network of Figure 7-7b
with the valves fully open. The intersection of the pump and the
piping curves is the “balance point,” indicating the head and flow
rate condition where that particular combination will operate. Com-
puter simulation permits analysis of components so that a system of
20 coils, for example, can be optimized by using 4 three-way valves
at the hydraulically most remote points and 16 two-way valves
without a need for relief valves.
With three-way valve control, the piping curve remains essen-
tially constant regardless of the load demanded by the coils. The
pump continues to deliver 2250 gpm [142 L/s] against a head of
100 ft [299 kPa]. With the two-way valve control, however, the pip-
ing network pressure drop increases as the flow rate is reduced—
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐171
which produces a different piping system curve for each new
adjustment. Two such different curves with their different balance
points are shown in Figure 7-8. Pump performance changes signifi-
cantly over the range of operation with the changing characteristics
of the piping network. As the flow rate is decreased and the operat-
ing condition moves upward and to the left along the pump charac-
teristic, the pump efficiency increases from 75% to and through its
maximum of 85%, then decreases again. The power requirement of
the pump decreases as the water flow is throttled off.
One of the basic decisions pertaining to system cost is illus-
trated in Figures 7-6 and 7-8. Consider the specification of a system
of large-diameter pipe with its resultant low pressure drop. While
this may increase the piping cost, it may be possible to use a smaller
pump, such as the one with the 11 in. [280 mm] diameter impeller
shown in Figure 7-6. This pump might be slightly lower in first
cost, but its big advantage lies in the lower energy costs for pump-
ing. Both the system curve and the pump curve will lie lower on the
graph in Figure 7-8, and the power requirements at the balance
point will be reduced. Note how changes in one element of the sys-
tem (the piping) impose changed operating conditions on another
element of the system (the pump).
7.5.2 Two-Pipe System
7.5.2.1 Changeover. For a system using outdoor air, there is
an outdoor temperature at which mechanical cooling is no longer
Figure 7-8. Pump and piping network curves.
172⏐ AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
required. At this point, the cooling requirement can be met using
outdoor air only—essentially an economizer operation. At even
lower temperatures, heating rather than cooling is needed. All-air
systems capable of operating with 100% outdoor air rarely require
mechanical cooling at outdoor air temperatures below 50°F or
55°F [10.0°C or 12.8°C]. Since air-and-water systems involve
considerably less airflow than all-air systems, however, they may
require mechanical cooling well below an outdoor temperature of
50°F [10°C].
The transition from summer to intermediate season to winter
is gradual—although rapidly changing weather patterns can
require transitions in system performance over the course of a 24-
hour period. The changeover from cooling to heating system oper-
ation should mirror this transition. This is not easy with a two-
pipe system; it is substantially easier with a three- or four-pipe
system. With a two-pipe system, the change in operation starts
gradually, with an increase in the primary air temperature as the
outdoor temperature decreases. This prevents zones with small
cooling loads from becoming too cold. The water side provides
cold water during both summer and intermediate season opera-
tion. Figure 7-9 illustrates the psychrometrics of summer-cycle
operation near the changeover temperature.
As the outdoor temperature drops further, the changeover tem-
perature is reached. At this point, the water system changes from
providing cold water to providing hot water for heating. This
changeover temperature is empirically given (Carrier 1965) by
tco = tr – [S + L + P – 1.1(tr – tp)]/T ,
(7-3)
where
P = heat gain from lights, Btu/h [W];
L = sensible heat gain from people, Btu/h [W];
S = net solar heat gain at time of changeover, Btu/h [W];
T = transmission per degree, defined as heat flow per degree dif-
ference between space temperature and outdoor temperature,
which includes transmission through walls, windows, and
roofs, if applicable, Btu/h°F [W/°C];
tco= changeover temperature, °F [°C];
tp = primary air temperature after changeover, normally taken as
56°F [13.3°C]; and
tr = room temperature at changeover, normally taken as 72°F
[22.2°C].
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐173
System changeover can take several hours depending upon
system size, and it usually results in a temporary upset of room
temperatures. Good design, therefore, includes provisions for
operating the system with either hot or cold water over a range of
10°F to 15°F [5.6°C to 8.3°C] below the changeover point. This
minimizes the frequency of changeover by making it possible to
operate with warm air and cold water on cold nights when the out-
door temperature rises above the changeover temperature during
the day. This limits operation below the changeover point to peri-
ods of protracted cold weather.
Optional hot or cold water operation below the changeover
point is provided by increasing the primary air reheat capacity so
that it can provide adequate heat during colder outdoor tempera-
tures. Figure 7-10 shows temperature variations of primary air and
water for a system with changeover.
7.5.2.2 Nonchangeover. Nonchangeover systems should be
considered in order to simplify system operation for buildings that

system prior to changeover.
174⏐ AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
experience mild winter climates. Such a system operates on the
intermediate season cycle throughout the heating season, as shown
in Figure 7-11. Heating may be provided during unoccupied hours
either by operating the primary system with 100% return air or by
switching the system and room controls to hot water for gravity
heating without air circulation.
7.5.2.3 A/T Ratio. The A/T ratio is a factor to consider in the
design of air-and-water systems.
A/T ratio = (primary airflow to space) /
(transmission loss per degree)
(7-4)
where the denominator is as defined under Equation 7-3. All spaces
on a common primary air zone should have approximately the same
A/T ratio, which is used to establish the primary air reheat schedule
during the intermediate season. Spaces with A/T ratios higher than
the design-base A/T will be overcooled during light cooling loads,
and spaces with ratios lower than the design ratio will lack suffi-
cient heat during cool weather above the changeover point.
Figure 7-10. Typical temperatures for system changeover.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐175
Calculate the minimum A/T ratio for each space by using the
primary air quantity necessary to satisfy the requirements for venti-
lation, dehumidification, and both summer and winter cooling, as
defined in Section 7.4. The design-base A/T ratio is the highest
ratio thus obtained, and the airflow to each space is increased as
required to obtain a uniform A/T ratio across all spaces.
For each A/T ratio there is a specific relationship between the
outdoor air temperature and the temperature of the primary air sup-
plied to a terminal unit that will maintain a room at 72°F [22.2°C]
or higher during conditions of minimum room cooling load.
Figure 7-12 illustrates this relationship based upon an assumed
minimum load of ten times the T-value, i.e., a difference of 10°F
[5.6°C] between outdoor and space temperatures.
Deviation from the target A/T ratio of up to 0.7 times the max-
imum value is permissible for massive buildings with high thermal
inertia, but A/T ratios should be closely maintained for buildings
with less mass, large glass areas, with curtain wall construction, or
on systems with a low changeover temperature.

7.5.2.4 Zoning. A properly designed single-water-zone two-pipe
system can provide good temperature control throughout the year. Its
performance can be improved by zoning in several ways:
•
Primary air zoning that will permit different A/T ratios on dif-
ferent exposures. All spaces on the same primary air zone
should have the same A/T ratio. If minimum A/T ratios for
the spaces in one zone vary due to different solar exposures,
air quantities can be increased for some of the spaces. It is
often useful to zone primary air for northerly (north, north-
east, northwest) exposures on a separate zone with reduced
air quantities.
•
Primary air zoning that will permit compensation of primary
air temperature. Peak cooling loads for southern exposures

usually occur during winter months because of high solar
loads. Therefore, primary air zoning can be used to reduce air
quantities and terminal unit coil sizes for these exposures.
Units can be selected for cold instead of reheated primary air,
thus reducing operating costs on all solar exposures by reduc-
ing primary air reheat and water-side refrigeration needs.
•
Zoning both air and water to permit different changeover tem-
peratures. Separate air and water zoning permits northerly
exposures to operate on a winter cycle with warm water at out-
door temperatures as high as 60°F [15.6°C], whereas other
exposures operate on intermediate or summer cycles at those
temperatures. Primary air quantity can be lower due to a sepa-
rate A/T ratio, and operating costs due to reheat and refrigera-
tion are reduced.
7.5.2.5 Evaluation. The two-pipe air-and-water system was
the first to be developed and is frequently used. Least expensive of
the water distribution arrangements to install, it is less capable of
handling wide variations in loads than the three- or four-pipe sys-
tem arrangements. Changeover is cumbersome, and operating costs
are higher than for a four-pipe system.
7.5.3 Three-Pipe Systems
Because of their wasteful energy performance (see Section 8.6),
these systems are rarely installed and design information is essentially
found in the ASHRAE Handbook archives—detailed discussions can
be found in the 1973 and 1976 ASHRAE Handbook—Systems.
7.5.4 Four-Pipe Systems
In four-pipe systems (see Section 8.5), the terminal unit is
often provided with two independent water coils—one served by
hot water, the other by chilled water. As an alternative, a common
coil may be used, with this coil being served by two supply and two
return pipes from the chilled- and hot-water loops, respectively
(Figure 7-13). The primary air is cold and is typically kept at the
same temperature year-round. During peak cooling and heating
conditions, a four-pipe system performs in a manner similar to a
two-pipe system with essentially the same operating characteristics
(Figures 7-4 and 7-5). During intermediate seasons, any unit can be
operated at any capacity from maximum cooling to maximum heat-
ing without regard to the operation of any other unit. Thus, distribu-
tion zoning is not required for either the air or the water system.
178⏐ AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
This system is more flexible than two- or three-pipe systems.
While its installation cost is higher, its efficiency is higher, and its
operating cost is lower than that of the other two distribution
arrangements. Operation is more simple than for a two- or
three-pipe system. No changeover is required. Standby water
pumps and heat exchangers should be considered for critical
applications, where loss of heating capacity would have unaccept-
able consequences.
7.6 REFRIGERATION LOAD
The refrigeration load equals the total building block load to be
removed by the combination of air and water systems:
Figure 7-13. Room unit control for a four-pipe system.

R = (4.5 Qp Δh) + [qs – 1.1 Qp (tr – ts)] + [qL – 4840 Qp (Wr – Ws)]

where

Qp = primary airflow rate, cfm [L/s]

rooms, °F [°C]
Wr = average room humidity ratio for all rooms at peak load, lb/lb
[kg/kg]
Ws = average primary air humidity ratio at point of delivery to
rooms, lb/lb [kg/kg]
The first term on the right side of Equation 7-5 is the load on
the primary air cooling coil, while the remaining two terms repre-
sent the load on the terminal unit water system.
7.7 ELECTRIC HEAT OPTION
Electricity may be used as a heat source either by installing a
central electric boiler and hot-water terminal coils or individual
electric resistance heating coils in the terminal units.
One design approach is to size the electric terminal resistance
heaters for the peak winter heating load and to operate the chilled-
water system as a nonchangeover cooling-only system, thus avoid-
ing the problems of hot-water/chilled-water changeover. One disad-
vantage of this system is the wide swing in supply air temperature
that will result if the electric coil is cycled instead of modulated.
Another approach is to use a small electric resistance terminal
heater for the intermediate season heating requirements in conjunc-
tion with a two-pipe changeover-type chilled-water/hot-water sys-
tem. The electric heater is used with outdoor temperatures no lower
than 30°F or 40°F [–1°C or 4°C]. System or zone reheating of the
primary air, as required for a two-pipe system, is greatly reduced or
eliminated. Changeover to hot water occurs at lower outdoor tem-
180⏐ AIR-AND-WATER SYSTEMS
peratures and is, thus, limited to a few times per year. Simultaneous
heating/cooling capacity is available, except in extremely cold
weather when little cooling is required.
7.8 CLOSED-LOOP WATER-SOURCE HEAT PUMPS
Many large buildings have substantial core areas that experi-
ence no transmission losses but do have internal heat gains. These
internal areas require cooling year-round during occupied hours.
Rather than reject the heat extracted from these core areas to the
atmosphere, this heat can be used as a heat source for a heat pump
system serving the perimeter of a building. A closed-loop heat
pump system (Figure 7-14) can serve this purpose.
The closed water loop serves as a heat sink for the interior
(cooling) heat pump units; it also serves as a heat source for
water-to-water or water-to-air heat pumps used to heat the perime-
Figure 7-14. Closed-loop water-to-air heat pump system schematic.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐181
ter. This synergistic relationship increases the overall system coeffi-
cient of performance (COP). The temperature of the closed water
loop is usually kept between 65°F and 90°F [18°C and 32°C], but
the heat pump manufacturer should be consulted as to the range the
selected unit can withstand. When the loop temperature drops
below the lower limit, a boiler is used to raise it. When the higher
limit is exceeded, heat is rejected from the loop via a cooling tower.
No insulation is required for the water loop piping as long as the
ambient temperature surrounding the piping is in the 60°F to 80°F
[16°C to 27°C] range.
Water-source heat pumps require 2 to 3 gpm [0.13 to 0.19 L/s]
in circulation per ton [3.5 kW] of refrigeration based upon the sum
of the nominal tonnage of the units (usually much higher than the
block load). This flow rate is generally constant during both cooling
and heating modes. Since water must circulate continuously
throughout the entire closed loop as long as a single unit is operat-
ing, the annual pumping costs for these systems can be high. To
reduce unnecessary water circulation, control valves should be
installed to shut off water flow to a heat pump when the compressor
is off. When core areas need only minimal or no cooling during a
significant portion of the day (e.g., apartment houses or hotels with
infrequently used public areas), greater than anticipated use of the
supplementary boiler to compensate for heat not being provided by
the core units can reduce or eliminate the benefits of the looped heat
pump system’s high COP.
A closed-loop heat pump system permits a landlord to wire
each heat pump unit to a respective tenant’s electric meter, thereby
effectively charging each tenant in proportion to the tenant’s use.
This can be valuable when a tenant operates around-the-clock
rooms with process loads or performs extensive night and weekend
work. Performance comparisons of a water-source heat pump sys-
tem with a fan-coil all-water system are given in Section 8.11. Fre-
quently, the two are considered competitive system options.

and Heat Pumps” and “Applied Heat Pump and Heat Recovery Sys-
tems” chapters in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Systems and

8.1 INTRODUCTION
In an all-water system, space cooling and/or heating is pro-
vided by chilled and/or hot water circulated from a central refriger-
ation/boiler plant to terminal units located in, or immediately
adjacent to, the various conditioned spaces. Heat transfer to/from
the room air occurs via forced or natural convection. Except for
radiant systems, radiant heat transfer is usually nominal due to the
size and arrangement of the heat transfer surfaces. All-water sys-
tems can be employed for both heating and cooling. Heating water
is supplied either through the same piping network used for chilled
water in summer or through an independent piping system. These
options are discussed in Sections 8.4 and 8.5.
Radiant panel cooling systems, other than those used for indus-
trial process cooling, are usually coupled with a dehumidified air
supply to prevent in-room condensation. For the purposes of this
manual, they are considered to be air-and-water systems.
The fundamentals of using water as a medium for distributing
cooling and heating effect are discussed in the “Hydronic Heating
and Cooling System Design” chapter in the ASHRAE Hand-
book—HVAC Systems and Equipment. All-water systems are
often selected as an appropriate project solution based upon three
key attributes:
1.
With regard to both space demands and energy use, water is a
more efficient medium for energy transport than air. The
reduced distribution requirements of all-water systems are
especially valuable in retrofit situations in existing buildings
where space for running ductwork is limited or nonexistent.
2.
Recirculation of air through a central system is unnecessary;
therefore, commingling of odors and other contaminants from
CHAPTER 8
ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
184⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
various tenants and concerns over smoke spreading from space
to space through a central air system are eliminated.
3.
First cost is often less than for other systems, depending upon
the desired number of control zones and terminal locations. If a
terminal is desired at every window, an all-water system could
be economically advantageous.
To verify the first attribute, consider the size of a supply duct
with air flowing at a velocity of 2000 fpm [10.2 m/s], supplied at
55°F [12.8°C] to maintain a space at 75°F [23.9°C], and compare
the duct area required with that for pipes (supply and return) circu-
lating water at 6 fps [1.8 m/s], operating at a 10°F [5.6°C] rise to
produce the same rate of cooling.
duct area / pipe area =
(8-1)
While this may be an oversimplification, it indicates the rela-
tive volumetric demands of the two media for transporting heat.
Pumps also require far less power than do fans for delivery of the
same energy content. Space must also be provided for ducts to
relieve/exhaust or return air that has been supplied to a space, for
insulation on ductwork and piping, and for drains to remove con-
densate from pans under condensing coils in terminals. Water sys-
tems (all-water and air-and-water) typically require in-space
terminal units, whereas all-air systems typically take up no space
within a room.
8.2 APPLICATIONS
8.2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages
Among the major advantages of all-water systems are:
•
Less building space is required for distribution elements.
•
They are well suited for retrofit applications due to their distri-
bution efficiency.
•
Little (often no) space is needed for a central fan room.
•
There is ready potential for individual room control with little
or no cross-contamination of air between rooms.
•
Because low-temperature water can be used for heating, they
are well suited for solar heating and heat recovery applications.

Among the disadvantages of all-water systems are:
•
Maintenance demands can be high and maintenance must be
performed on terminals within occupied spaces.
•
Condensate drain pans and a drain system are required; in addi-
tion, they must be cleaned periodically.
•
Ventilation is not centrally provided or controlled and is often
accomplished by opening windows or via an outdoor air inlet
at each terminal unit; thus, providing for acceptable indoor air
quality can be a serious concern.
•
Relative humidity in spaces may be high in summer, particu-
larly if modulating chilled-water valves are used to control
room temperature.
More detailed comparisons between all-water systems and
other systems are presented in Section 8.11.
8.2.2 Suitability to Building Types
In the past, all-water systems were widely used in office build-
ings, hospitals, nursing homes, multifamily residences, hotels, and
schools. They are well suited to perimeter spaces with seasonally
predictable cooling and heating requirements. When selected for
spaces with nearly constant or year-round cooling demands, chilled
water must be supplied throughout the year or alternative means of
cooling by outdoor air must be provided. All-water systems are not
well suited for interior spaces. Also, they are not good choices
where close control of ventilation (for indoor air quality) and rela-
tive humidity is important. On the other hand, they readily offer
individual room temperature control capability. The fact that the
circulation of water requires significantly less space and energy
than the circulation of air accounts for the popularity of all-water
systems in apartment buildings and hotels. Even more important in
these applications is the separation and independence that can be
achieved between tenancies.
For better quality hotel and motel guest rooms, all-water fan-
coil systems can compete with water-source heat pumps. Either
system should be supported with a ventilation air supply for quality
air conditioning—essentially making the solution an air-water sys-
tem. These two systems are also competitive alternatives in large
apartment buildings, where a ducted supply of ventilation air is also
desirable (but is less frequently provided). For perimeter class-
rooms in schools, unit ventilator all-water systems are frequently
186⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
considered along with unitary-type unit ventilators or vari-
able-air-volume (VAV) systems with supplemental perimeter heat.
Office building applications distinctly favor VAV systems.
All-water systems can be far easier to adapt to existing struc-
tures than any other type of system because of their limited space
requirements. All-water fan-coil systems are common in churches
and other monumental or historic buildings because of this
attribute, even where humidity control is important for artifact pres-
ervation (despite the fact that such systems are inferior in that
respect to all-air constant-volume systems).
8.3 SYSTEM CONCEPTS
All-water systems, as typically installed, can be classified into
three basic types:
1.
Two-pipe systems, in which the terminal units are served by two
water pipes—a supply and a return. Chilled or hot water is circu-
lated alternately through the single closed loop to the terminals.
2.
Three-pipe systems, in which each terminal has a separate
chilled- and hot-water supply but only a single, common return.
3.
Four-pipe systems, in which two separate piping systems sup-
ply and return either hot water or chilled water to separate coils
(or a single dual-use coil) within the terminal units.
8.4 TWO-PIPE SYSTEMS
8.4.1 Basic Two-Pipe System
This system is composed of central water cooling and heating
equipment, terminal units, pumps, distribution piping, and system
and terminal controls. Each terminal is connected to a single supply
pipe and a single return pipe. In the cooling mode, chilled water cir-
culates to the terminals to accomplish both sensible and latent cool-
ing. In the heating mode, hot water circulates to the terminals for
sensible heating. Room temperature is controlled at the terminal by
automatically or manually regulating air or water flow or both. In
its simplest form, the entire system must be in either cooling or
heating mode. Some spaces served by such a system, however, may
require cooling, while others need heating, resulting in unsatisfac-
tory performance. It may be possible to group spaces with common
heating or cooling requirements together into a single zone. By
design of the circulating system and its control, some zones can be
operated on cooling while others are on heating. The zoning, piping
arrangement, and controls to achieve this limited flexibility within a
two-pipe arrangement demand careful design.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐187
Zones can frequently be divided according to exposure. Zoning
is practical for spaces where solar heat gains during spring and fall
are the predominant factor in establishing a need for heating or
cooling. Shadows from other buildings or wings that vary through-
out the day (not just at peak-load time), however, can defeat this
approach. Occasionally each major piping branch, perhaps a single
set of risers, is designed to serve one zone. The mode (heating or
cooling) for terminals connected to that branch may be indexed to a
key space thermostat or discriminator control circuitry. This config-
uration is actually a cross between the two-pipe concept and the
four-pipe concept described later.
The piping arrangement illustrated in Figure 8-1 contains both
a heating and a cooling pump. When zones require both condition-
ing modes, both hot and chilled water are available. The chilled-
water pump must have adequate capacity to maintain the minimum
required flow through the chiller. If only cooling is needed, the hot-
water pump can be turned off. If only heating is needed, the chilled-
water pump can be turned off. It is feasible to use the two pumps
operating in parallel to circulate chilled water. Operating in this
mode, hot water is not available to the system, but total pumping
capacity can be shared. During intermediate seasons, and possibly
throughout the heating season as well, partial system water flow is
usually adequate to meet the space thermal needs. It is important to
Figure 8-1. Multizone two-pipe all-water system (Carrier 1965).
188⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
lay out the return piping in a manner that will avoid the blending of
hot and chilled water upstream of the chiller or hot water generator.
Control valves on both supply and return circuits are necessary
to switch to the appropriate source for a zone. Changeover from one
mode to the other can be a difficult choice, since the required mode
depends upon several factors, such as outdoor temperature and solar
load. Solar-compensated outdoor temperature sensors lagged to sim-
ulate the building’s thermal storage or “flywheel” characteristics have
been employed. Keying to selected room thermostats and manual
switching are other techniques of zone cooling/heating changeover.
Unfortunately, all these control concepts have shortcomings.
The foregoing discussion suggests that system design may
become quite complicated in order to provide appropriate zoning.
The additional expense for piping, pumps, and controls may rival or
exceed that of an inherently superior system concept, which is to
provide a cooling/heating alternative at each terminal using a
four-pipe system. The temperature in rooms equipped with fan-coil
units is maintained by fan ON/OFF or speed control, by ON/OFF or
variable water flow control, or by both. Vertical riser units with
series-connected terminal units can be controlled by bypassing air
around the heat transfer surface using face and bypass dampers.
Varying unit water flow as a method of room temperature control is
not feasible through units arranged in series.
Unless the conditioned space is dehumidified by a supplemen-
tal air-conditioning system, both sensible and latent cooling are per-
formed by the terminal unit coil. The sensible heat ratio of the
cooling process in a given space will vary widely over time. This
variation will be most extreme if ventilation air is introduced
through windows or unit intakes in an exterior wall. Since room
temperature is the basis for unit control, humidity control is inci-
dental. Relative humidity can vary widely, as depicted in
Figures 8-2 and 8-3. Control solely by manually operating the fan is
unsatisfactory. Automatic control of fan operation with manual
selection of fan speed results in intermittent airflow through the
occupied space, temperature swings near the outside wall, and
potentially annoying sound pressure level variations. These charac-
teristics are similar, however, to those of residential forced-air heat-
ing systems, and in many multi-residence applications of fan-coil
units they have been accepted as tolerable. As Figures 8-2 and 8-3
indicate, superior control of humidity is more likely with fan con-
trol than with water flow control because humid outdoor air may
continue to be brought in even though the thermostat is satisfied
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐189
and the chilled-water flow is at a minimum while the fan continues
to run. Tight-sealing dampers on wall openings should be automati-
cally closed when the unit fan is off. Use of water flow control in
combination with ventilation via wall apertures incurs a real risk of
coil freeze-up in cold weather.
Manual fan control along with ON/OFF or modulating control of
water flow can be viewed as an improvement to automatic fan con-
trol in other respects (although this approach can lose control over
humidity). This is true of cost (which is higher) as well as perfor-
mance. ON/OFF water flow control can cause frequent cycling of the
supply air temperature—although potentially annoying, this is the
same effect as seen with thermostatic control of a DX system. Qui-
Figure 8-2. Room temperature and humidity variation under manual
three-speed fan control (Carrier 1965).
190⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
etly operating solenoid valves can minimize the bothersome clicks
that occur as the valves are actuated by the thermostats. A room
thermostat is preferred over a return air thermostat, since it will
sense the occupied space temperature even if the fan is off. When
the system mode is changed, a second thermostat that senses system
water temperature (an aquastat, available with the terminal) must
reverse the action of the room thermostat.
8.4.2 Two-Pipe System plus Supplemental Heating
Fan-coil units can be obtained with auxiliary electric heating
coils. This approach can materially reduce the difficulties of
changeover between cooling and heating modes. As long as cooling
by chilled water circulated through the terminals is necessary to
counter solar heat gain and other transient cooling loads, overcool-
ing of other spaces with a net heat loss on the same system can be
prevented by energizing the electric coil. This will probably elimi-
nate the need for the complex zoning layout previously described.
Even if total heating by electric resistance heat is not cost-effective,
Figure 8-3. Room temperature and humidity variation under auto-
matically modulated water control with continuous fan operation (Car-
rier 1965).
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐191
electric heating during the intermediate seasons may be justified by
reduced piping and control costs as well as by a significant perfor-
mance improvement balanced against increased unit and electrical
distribution costs.
Control of cooling must be by chilled-water flow valves or by
face and bypass dampers. Such control is then sequenced with ON/
OFF control of the electric heater energized through a magnetic
contactor. Both cooling and heating are under control of a common
thermostat. When hot water is supplied for heating, the unit aqu-
astat reverses the control action of the room thermostat on the
water valve and de-energizes the electric heater circuit. Only heat-
ing by hot water is then available. The electric heater is de-ener-
gized whenever the fan is not operating. The system mode
changeover decision is less critical but still involves the numerous
variables previously mentioned. More often than not, the pivotal
rationale for the decision is economic. Owners are reluctant to
incur monthly electrical demand charges for short-period operation
of their refrigeration plants. Therefore, the changeover decision is
governed by the calendar—so many months on cooling and so
many on heating. Not infrequently, the months when cooling will
be available become a lease provision, but many tenants will not
accept such a lease restriction.
8.4.3 Two-Pipe Systems with Total Electric Heat
If electric heating is economically justifiable throughout the
year, the need to change water supply from cooling to heating and
vice versa is eliminated. Unit control is simplified; reversa1 of the
room thermostat action is unnecessary. Chilled-water circulation
and refrigeration can be discontinued when there is little or no need
for cooling, and zoning of distribution circuits is unnecessary. A
significant advantage is that the electric power source for heating
and air circulation can be via the tenant connection and can thus be
separately metered. For some occupancies, in some jurisdictions,
this is a legal requirement as an energy conservation measure.
8.5 FOUR-PIPE SYSTEMS
Figure 8-4 shows a schematic layout of a typical four-pipe sys-
tem, including basic system controls. Providing two independent
water distribution systems—one dedicated to chilled water and the
other to hot water—permits either cooling or heating by individual
room terminals throughout the year. Each terminal unit is equipped
with a heating and a cooling coil (or a dual-use coil) and two
192⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
Figure 8-4. Piping schematic for a four-pipe fan-coil system (Carrier 1965).
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐193
water-flow control valves (or equivalent coil bypass control) and is
connected to the distribution system by four pipes—supply and
return for both chilled and hot water. Both valves are controlled in
sequence by the room thermostat. A dead band of several degrees is
normally incorporated into the control. In this band, both valves are
closed. This feature prevents valve cycling with frequent shifts
between heating and cooling and reduces energy use. In practice,
the lowest and quietest unit fan speed is adequate most of the time.
The four-pipe arrangement and the two-pipe arrangement with total
electric heating offer significant advantages over the simple
two-pipe concept, such as
•
year-round availability of heating and cooling for individual
space temperature control,
•
elimination of zoning cost and complexity, and
•
simpler changeover decisions.
The usual operating practice is to discontinue the circulation
of chilled water in winter and that of hot water in summer. Based
upon this premise, some designs have incorporated system
changeover modes that employ both of the distribution systems for
cooling in summer and for heating in winter. Chilled and hot water
both remain available during the intermediate seasons. The impe-
tus for this variation is reduced pumping capacity and smaller pipe
sizes, offset to some degree by the loss of versatility, the increased
burden of changeover decisions, the complexity of terminal valve
control, and the added provisions needed to switch the pumps to
different duties.
8.6 THREE-PIPE SYSTEMS
Three-pipe systems have separate chilled- and hot-water sup-
ply piping, a single coil, and common return piping. Terminal con-
trol is via a three-way valve that admits water from either the hot-
or the chilled-water supply as required but does not mix the supply
streams. The valve is specially designed so that the hot port gradu-
ally moves from open to fully closed, and the cold port gradually
moves from fully closed to open. At mid-range, there is an interval
in which both ports are completely closed. The water returns
through common piping to either a chiller or a boiler.
Once popular for perimeter spaces of large buildings because
they avoided many of the changeover problems associated with
two-pipe systems, three-pipe systems have been virtually replaced
194⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
by other options (including four-pipe systems). While some ver-
sions of three-pipe systems proved successful, many were plagued
with excessive mixing of hot and chilled water in the common
return and consequent energy waste.
8.7 PIPING DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Several issues are of special importance to the design of water
distribution networks for all-water systems.
8.7.1 Flow Diversity
The system (block) peak cooling load is likely to be less than
the sum of the space peak loads. If the cooling capacity of the ter-
minal units is automatically controlled using two-way valves, it is
improbable that all valves will be fully opened concurrently. Conse-
quently, some reduction from the sum of the individual terminal
flows is possible in selecting pumps and sizing pipe mains. In the-
ory, the diversity factor may be viewed as the ratio of the block
cooling load to the sum of the peak loads for each terminal. Such a
theory is based upon the supposition that all space thermostats are
set at the design space temperature and that flow is reduced in direct
proportion to terminal load reductions. Neither is correct because
other operating conditions also affect the degree of diversity. A gen-
eral rule is to reduce the aggregate flow of all terminals by a diver-
sity factor equal to the square root of the ratio of the block load to
the sum of the peaks. Diversity should not be applied to risers or
horizontal mains serving only a single building orientation.
8.7.2 Water Pressure and Flow Balance
Balancing the water flow through a large number of parallel-
connected coils is at best difficult and laborious. With reasonable
care in design, however, a water distribution network can be suffi-
ciently self-balancing to make field adjustment of terminal coil
flow generally unnecessary. Inclusion of automatic flow control
valves can also move a system toward a self-balancing condition.
Chilled-water flow variations within 25% of design flow affect a
fan-coil unit’s cooling capacity on the order of 10%. This provides
considerable tolerance. Consequently, some difference in the flow
resistance of the piping circuits conveying water to the many termi-
nals is tolerable without significantly affecting the performance of
terminals situated on the longer runs. Two conditions, however,
must be met:
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐195
1.
The flow resistance in the parallel terminal subcircuits is at
least equal to 40% of the variation of the pressure drops in the
distribution piping circuits, i.e., the difference between the
greatest and the least pressure drop in the circuits.
2.
The pressure drops of the parallel subcircuits have reasonable
consistency, i.e., where possible, avoid mixing high and low
loss terminals on common circuits. A subcircuit includes the
control and manual valves, the connecting piping, and the ter-
minal unit coil.
A closed piping loop may be designed as either direct return or
reverse return (see Figures 8-5 and 8-6). The direct-return system is
popular because it requires less piping; however, balancing valves
may be required on subcircuits. Since all water flow distances are vir-
tually the same in a reverse-return system, balancing valves require
less adjustment. It is possible, with careful piping layout, to provide
many of the advantages of a reverse-return piping system while keep-
ing piping lengths similar to a direct-return piping system.
Quantitative evaluation of the flow variations that a circuit
imbalance creates is beyond the scope of normal system design pro-
tocols. As a general guideline, an imbalance of 10 to 15 ft (30 to
45 kPa) of head is safe. This latitude allows the use of direct return
risers; the imbalance can be controlled by judicious pipe sizing.

Figure 8-6. Reverse-return piping system.
196⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
Reverse-return design of horizontal mains looping within a building
perimeter and feeding risers usually does not incur significant addi-
tional piping expense over direct return and is good practice. Mains
that serve major sections of a building and are parallel connected
with each other should be provided with a means for balancing and
flow measuring.
8.7.3 Control of System Pressure Differential
Where two-way valve control of water flow through terminal
unit coils is employed, the system flow will be reduced at partial
load. The valves reduce flow by adding resistance to the coil piping
subcircuit. As flow is reduced, pipe friction also decreases and
available pump head increases, requiring even further closure of the
terminal valves. If the differential pressure imposed across these
valves becomes great enough, the maximum shutoff pressure rating
of the valves could be exceeded. The valves would not close,
defeating space temperature control. Barring that, “wire drawing”
at the valve seat is a real possibility, which could lead to costly
replacement of the terminal valve seats. Wire drawing involves ero-
sion of the valve disk and seat by high fluid velocities in valves that
operate for extended periods at minimal opening. Several preven-
tive measures are available to a designer:
1.
Control the system pressure differential with taps in the supply
and return piping, usually located at the hydraulically most
remote terminal device in the piping network, to vary the speed
of the pump, reducing its capacity and developed head at part
load, as described in Section 8.8.
2.
Regulate a throttling valve in the supply mains (near the pump
discharge) from a system pressure differential controller (in
lieu of speed control). This shifts part of the task of restricting
flow from the terminal valves (see Figure 8-4) by maintaining
an artificial head on the pump.
3.
Install three-way valves at the terminals in lieu of two-way
valves. At reduced load, the valves bypass the coils. This incurs
some disadvantage since these bypasses are, in effect, short cir-
cuits unless a resistance equal to the terminal water coil is built
into each bypass—which can be accomplished with automatic
flow control or balancing valves located on the return line after
the bypass valve. Without this, at partial system load, system
flow will actually increase, as will pumping horsepower. Also,
some terminals may be starved of water, since the pressure dif-
ferential at those terminals may fall below that needed to
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐197
deliver the water flow desired by the space thermostat. The
installed cost of three-way valves is somewhat higher than for
two-way valves. Some designers favor a single bypass valve,
located near the extremities of the mains, that is controlled by
system pressure differential. The effect is similar to a main
throttling valve but can have the effect of increasing system
flow and horsepower. A spring-loaded relief valve is unsuitable
for this purpose; an industrial-quality control valve is required.
4.
Install a combination of two- and three-way terminal valves.
This practice limits the reduction of flow and the buildup of
pressure differential across the terminal valves without a need
to control flow velocity, main throttling valves, or a bypass
valve. A little study will indicate the percentage mix, but a lay-
out that ensures a minimum of about 20% of the total system
flow generally suffices. Locating the three-way valves in the
greater-resistance paths ensures good flow throughout the
extremities of a direct-return system.
5.
Use automatic flow-limiting valves (also called pressure-inde-
pendent control valves). These valves are designed to provide
consistent coil flow conditions in the face of varying system
pressures (caused by the opening and closing of valves
throughout the water distribution system). Such valves can be
especially beneficial in two-pipe distribution arrangements,
where water flow rates differ from heating and cooling service
at any given load. They also permit easier balancing of direct-
return distribution systems.
If a system is equipped solely with two-way valves, a no-flow
condition can occur at the pump. Serious damage to the pump could
result when the motor energy heats noncirculating water within the
pump impeller. Prevent this either by adopting a pressure control
option that will ensure flow or equip the pump with a bypass.
Another potential hazard relating to the use of two-way valve con-
trol is the freezing of sections of the distribution piping if exposed
to very low temperatures (possible in poorly insulated exterior wall
cavities under no-flow conditions).
8.7.4 System Cleanliness
The performance of an all-water system can be seriously
impaired by dirt and corrosion products in the piping system. The
following safeguards avoid this problem:
•
Protect piping material on the job site prior to installation.
•
Protect openings in the piping during installation.
•
Flush and chemically clean the piping system prior to operation.
198⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
•
Locate strainers upstream of pumps, chillers, and heat
exchangers.
•
Install scavenging (side-stream) filters in pump bypasses
selected for 5% to 10% of system flow.
•
Provide isolation valves and accessible drain connections for
risers.
8.8 VARIABLE-SPEED PUMP OPERATION
The characteristics of centrifugal pumps and piping networks fol-
low some special interrelations when the pumps are equipped to oper-
ate at variable speed. Pump theory states that the shutoff head (the
head at zero flow rate) is proportional to the square of the rotational
speed, as illustrated in Figure 8-7. This figure also illustrates the rela-
tionships between head, flow rate, pump speed, and efficiency.
Analogous to the fan laws (see Section 6.6.2), the pump laws
for centrifugal pumps are:
1.
Flow rate varies with speed (pump rpm).
Q = (N1 / N2)
Figure 8-7. Pump head, flow rate, and efficiency as functions of pump
speed (ITT 1985).
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐199
2.
Head varies with square of speed.
H = (N1 / N2)2
3.
Head varies with square of flow rate.
H = (Q1 / Q2)2
4.
Brake horsepower varies as the cube of the speed or flow rate.
P = (N1 / N2)3 P = (Q1 / Q2)3
where
Q = pump flow rate
H = pump head
N = pump speed, rpm
P = bhp [kW]
The third law (above) is precisely the characteristic of a piping
network. The combination of pump and piping relationships is
illustrated in Figure 8-8. If a pump operates at maximum efficiency
at the design point, then that pump serving a constant characteristic
system at various flow rates operates at maximum efficiency
throughout. This relationship must be tempered with several quali-
fications. The piping network might serve just a single thermal load
and the load requirements would control the speed of the pump. If
the piping system is a two-way valve network, as shown in
Figure 5-12, no single head-flow curve represents the complete per-
Figure 8-8. Combining the characteristics of a piping network with
those of a variable-speed pump for maximum efficiency.
200⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
formance map. The head-flow curve of the three-way valve network
in Figure 5-13 suggests a single head-flow curve, but actually it is
only one point—the design point—on that curve.
An opportunity to lower the pump delivery pressure must be
communicated to the speed control of the pump. One possibility for
sensing the adequacy of the pressure supplied by a pump is to mon-
itor the position of the two-way valves controlling water flow to the
coils. Ideally, only a single valve in a system should be completely
open. If valves are pneumatically actuated, the highest control pres-
sure (or lowest in the case of normally open valves) should be used
as the control variable to regulate pump speed. Similar control can
be achieved using direct digital control.
Designers have achieved efficient variable-volume pumping by
installing multiple pumps and shutting down one or more pumps to
approximately match the required system flow rate. System curves
to illustrate these conditions are shown in Figure 8-9 for two pumps
Figure 8-9. Pump and system curves for series pumping.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐201
in series and in Figure 8-10 for two pumps arranged in parallel.
Less pumping power is required, however, when flow rate is
adjusted downward by reducing pump speed instead of by throttling
flow or sequencing pumps. Many successful variable-volume
installations have been reported (ASHRAE 1988). The ready avail-
ability of VFD drives at reasonable cost makes their use more logi-
cal than in the past.
Variable-speed pumping should only be used with care in con-
junction with reset of the leaving chilled-water temperature (which
is based upon constant volume pumping). Temperature reset
upward increases chiller efficiency but keeps pumping power high.
The reduction in chiller power from reset should be compared
against the change in pumping power from variable-speed pump-
ing. Chiller kW/ton [kW/kW] increases with lowered chilled-water
supply temperatures and decreases conversely. Increasing chilled-
water temperature, however, potentially increases the flow require-
ments at the terminal units (for constant loads)—increasing water
flow rates. At low load conditions, however, the reduction in termi-
nal device cooling capacity caused by an increase in chilled-water
temperature can help to improve controllability by causing the con-
trol valve to open more to provide the required cooling capacity.
Variable-speed pumping is best suited to piping networks hav-
ing a high percentage of head loss that varies with the flow rate
Figure 8-10. Pump and system curves for parallel pumping.
202⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
(long piping runs) and a small percentage of constant head loss (ter-
minal units, valves, differences in elevation). Thus, in an equipment
room serving air handlers located close to a chiller, there is little
variable head loss, and a variable-speed pump would act very much
like the constant-speed pump whose characteristics are shown in
Figure 8-7.
8.9 TERMINALS
8.9.1 Fan-Coil Units
The fan-coil is the most common all-water room terminal. It
consists of a direct- or belt-driven fan that induces airflow through
a filter and discharges it through an extended surface coil for deliv-
ery into a room. The source air is room air or a mixture of room air
and outdoor ventilation air (obtained via a direct connection to the
exterior environment). An insulated drain pan beneath the coil col-
lects moisture condensed from the air as it passes over the cooling
coil. The unit may have an additional downstream heating coil
using electricity, steam, or hot water.
One type of vertical fan-coil unit integrates an extended heat
transfer surface with a supply and return chilled-water (or dual-tem-
perature) riser section. When stacked in a multistory building, these
column units virtually eliminate the need for separate water distri-
bution risers in a two-pipe system. Water flows through the unit
heat exchangers in series. With a direct return riser, the average
water temperature is approximately the same in all units on a riser.
On an upfeed system, the lowest unit has the coolest supply water
and the warmest return water. Thus, unit capacities are independent
of their vertical location on the riser. For a four-pipe system, addi-
tional heating coils are parallel connected to dedicated hot-water
heating risers. Some column units are designed with parallel-con-
nected coils factory connected to internal riser sections and are
therefore closely akin to the conventional type of unit. The unit
enclosure is also the riser enclosure. Air is discharged from a grille
(or grilles) near the ceiling and returned near the floor. With units
located on an exterior wall, the direction of air discharge is com-
monly parallel to the wall to offset the envelope heat loss or gain.
Various fan-coil unit arrangements are shown and described in the
“In-Room Terminal Systems” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—
HVAC Systems and Equipment.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐203
8.9.2 Unit Ventilators
Unit ventilators are similar to fan-coil units but have a more
elaborate provision for the direct introduction of outdoor air for
ventilation and, as an option, free cooling by outdoor air econo-
mizer cycle control (see Section 9.3.7). Unit ventilators are most
often applied in assembly occupancies, such as classrooms and
meeting rooms. They were historically the terminal of choice for
heating and ventilating classrooms prior to the increased use of
cooling in such spaces, and they continue to be installed either as
components of an all-water system or as unitary equipment.
8.9.3 Valance Units
A valance terminal depends upon natural convection for heat
transfer from a coil located in a valance enclosure placed near the
ceiling, usually along a perimeter building wall. Filters are not
employed, and ventilation is not a feature of this type of delivery
system. Space temperature is controlled by coil water flow. If cool-
ing is provided via the valence unit, a means for condensate
removal must be provided.
8.10 VENTILATION
If preconditioned air is supplied to a terminal unit, the system
becomes an air-water system. Thus, if ventilation air is associated
with an all-water terminal, it is typically drawn in through a
damper-controlled opening in the building wall. The damper is
motorized to close when the fan is off. The rate at which ventilation
air is introduced directly through an aperture in a building wall is
almost impossible to regulate because of wind pressure and stack
effect. Problems seen in the past with this approach to ventilation
include coils freezing and cold drafts resulting from excessive out-
door airflow. The quality of terminal unit dampers and damper con-
trols is, however, improving. On the lee side of a building, airflow
may reverse through an intake, even with a fan operating. In a high-
rise building during cold weather, excessive outdoor air can enter
through the unit openings on the lower floors and exfiltrate through
the unit openings on the upper floors. The shortcomings of this
approach to ventilation also include poor humidity control, wasted
energy, insect problems, and the potential for smoke entry from
fires on lower floors.
Ventilation must be provided, however, if the all-water
approach is to fulfill the function of adequate air conditioning
(including control of indoor air quality). The most common tech-
204⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
nique is to assign the ventilation function to exhaust systems, for
example, kitchen and bathroom exhausts in multifamily residences.
An ample source of makeup air is required for exhaust systems to
function properly. Windows, if operable, are usually allowed to
serve as ventilation sources by building codes. This is effective only
when the windows are open or if they are sufficiently leaky when
closed (not advisable for energy efficiency). The shortcomings to
ventilation via outdoor air entry through windows include poor
humidity control, excessive heating and cooling loads, and the
introduction of dirt and noise from outdoors directly into occupied
spaces. In practice, many occupants would rather put up with very
limited ventilation than incur the discomfort of involuntarily open
windows, especially in extreme weather or noise conditions. If the
windows are tightly closed and there is a significant exhaust air
requirement (as in the case of residential buildings), the conditioned
space will be subject to substantial negative pressure. Some makeup
air may enter from common corridors or hallways, although most
building codes prohibit undercutting of entranceways or the use of
exits as makeup air plenums. Fireplaces in apartments have some-
times become unanticipated makeup air passageways.
This discussion highlights a common design pitfall inherent in
all-water systems—lack of assured ventilation. In many building
types, the proper solution is a ducted, preconditioned (at least fil-
tered and tempered), fan-powered ventilation air supply. This adds
significantly to project cost and is at risk in any cost-trimming exer-
cise, sometimes by an unwary owner who may later hold the design
engineer responsible for not pointing out the consequences—espe-
cially with respect to indoor air quality.
8.11 SYSTEM EVALUATION AND COMPARISON
Each type of air-conditioning system offers advantages and
disadvantages that are of varying importance to different applica-
tions and clients. Generalizations should therefore be used with
care. Nonetheless, in the following discussion, all-water fan-coil
systems are compared with other HVAC system types with which
they frequently compete. These comparisons may provide a helpful
checklist to ensure that pertinent traits of the various systems are
considered in the selection process.

8.12 DESIGN SEQUENCE
8.12.1 System Selection—Getting Started
Several HVAC systems will usually be considered and com-
pared prior to determining which one is most appropriate for a spe-
cific project. Common starting points for the preliminary
consideration of systems are to (1) establish design intent and crite-
ria and (2) estimate cooling and heating loads for the portions of the
building to which the system is to be applied. This can be done by
load calculations or by estimations based upon experience. Design-
ers commonly use an estimating parameter of tons of refrigeration
(or Btu per hour) per square foot [kW/m2] of gross or net building
area as a quick estimate or validation check on more detailed calcu-
lations (see Table 2-1, Chapter 2). Such rules depend upon the spe-
cifics of application and location. Cooling load figures for several
situations may be found in the ASHRAE Pocket Guide (ASHRAE
2005). Many designers, however, prefer to develop their own check
figure values based upon previous project experiences. Influencing
factors include building envelope characteristics (such as type and
amount of fenestration), lighting levels, occupancy, ventilation, and
thermal comfort objectives.
8.12.2 All-Water System Development
Establish the method to be used to provide for ventilation early
during the preliminary design of an all-water system. Consider how
208⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
cooling and heating of the ventilation air will be handled by the sys-
tem terminal units. Following this, determine the specific system(s)
to be evaluated along with the types of terminals to be used. In
deciding whether to use fan-coil units or two- or four-pipe distribu-
tion systems, consider physical arrangement, performance, and eco-
nomic constraints and objectives.
The system control strategy should also be developed to a point
where the system’s capabilities are well understood. Try to answer
such questions as: How is space humidity to be controlled? What is
the likely changeover point? Is zoning by orientation necessary?
Will such zoning be workable and cost-effective? Once the concept
to be evaluated is fairly well set, the system can be further devel-
oped by “first cut” component selections.
8.12.3 Changeover Point
Before proceeding to the next step in preliminary design, an
explanation of changeover point is in order. In simple terms, the
changeover point for cooling is the outdoor air temperature below
which chilled water is no longer required to offset heat gain in any
zone. The changeover point for heating is the outdoor air tempera-
ture above which hot water is no longer required to offset heat loss.
A given zone no longer needs cooling by chilled water when
solar and internal heat gain = (space cooling by other systems)
+ (heat transmission losses) .
(8-2)
Changeover temperature (see also Section 7.5.2.1) can be cal-
culated as
tco = tr – (solar and internal heat gain – other cooling) / (VA) , (8-3)
where
tco =
changeover temperature,
tr
=
governing room temperature, and
VA =
heat transmission per degree of temperature difference
through the exterior envelope.
The calculation is approximate because the terms in the equation
vary with time. If solar and internal heat gains are taken as the
maximum for the time of year when tco is likely to occur, the low-
est outdoor temperature at which cooling is required will be
obtained; if solar and internal heat gains are taken as the minimum
anticipated, the highest outdoor temperature at which heating is
required will be obtained. The spread between the two values rep-
resents the range within which either heating or cooling may be
required. If the range is wide, as it might be for an office with
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐209
southern exposure and substantial but variable internal heat gain,
a two-pipe (either/or) arrangement is going to be a poor choice
and a two-pipe plus supplemental heat or a four-pipe distribution
should be considered. Note that northern or shaded exposures will
have decidedly different tco spread characteristics than those ori-
entations exposed to the sun.
Zoning must be considered with a two-pipe distribution in
order to permit spaces with similar changeover characteristics to be
grouped to allow some zones to be cooled while others are being
heated. Thereafter, a means of zone mode control must be devised,
as discussed in Section 8.3. Realize that changing over a system
from hot water to chilled water (and vice versa) takes time. Intro-
ducing warm water into a chiller could blow the refrigerant charge
and cause the tubes to loosen. Once a decision is made (either auto-
matically or manually) to shift modes, time must be allowed for the
water temperature to neutralize before the shift can be completed.
Occupants may be uncomfortable during this waiting period. An
understanding of changeover should help to illustrate the limita-
tions of a two-pipe distribution arrangement.
8.12.4 Preliminary Component Selection and Design
A schematic piping layout can now be prepared with terminal
unit, central cooling and heating, and pumping locations. Some
study is required to decide whether horizontal mains feeding verti-
cal risers, vertical mains with horizontal piping loops or branches
for each floor, or a hybrid piping arrangement is most efficient.
Reverse-return piping arrangements should also be evaluated. If
zoning by exposure (orientation) is to be used, the design must
allow for independent operation of each zone under heating or cool-
ing mode without mixing of water in a common return from zones
on different modes. With the number of terminal units established,
the total amount of water for fan-coil units may be roughly esti-
mated as 2.0–2.5 gpm per ton [0.033–0.042 L/s per kW] of block
load. If the maximum temperature rise (Δtmax) calculated as
Δtmax = (24) (block cooling load, tons) / (terminal water flow, gpm)
(8-4a)
[Δtmax = (0.24) (block cooling load, kW) / (terminal water flow, L/s)]
(8-4b)
is lower than the desired temperature drop in the chiller, or if the
flow through the terminal pumping system is not constant during the
cooling mode (which occurs under two-way-valve terminal control),
210⏐ ALL-WATER SYSTEMS
primary/secondary pumping circuits will be needed. This is com-
monly the case for all but smaller systems. Figure 8-1 shows a distri-
bution system with a single chilled-water pump, while Figure 8-4
shows a system with both primary and secondary pumps.
Preliminary modeling for construction cost and energy cost
estimating and space considerations may be further developed by
selecting a typical terminal unit, pump, chiller, and boiler/heat
exchanger. From this system model, the all-water concept can be
compared to other concepts by considering initial cost, energy cost,
performance capabilities, maintenance requirements, acoustics,
longevity, and space needs according to the Owner’s Project
Requirements. This preliminary design and evaluation, concluding
with a recommendation (usually during the schematic phase of
building design, as explained in Section 2.3), will facilitate the
approval of the final system selection by the owner.
8.12.5 Final Design
The final design process proceeds as follows:
•
Calculate room cooling and heating loads.

Select terminal units based upon established criteria for space
configuration, supply water temperature, sound pressure levels,
cooling and heating loads, and air distribution.

ing, and makeup and pipe drains.

anchor points, guides, and expansion bends or joints.

exchangers, and other accessory equipment, such as strainers
and filters.

9.1 DESICCANT SYSTEMS
9.1.1 The Context for Desiccant Dehumidification
Control of maximum relative humidity in a space is important
for both thermal comfort and indoor air quality (particularly with
respect to mold/mildew development). Maintaining active control
of humidity can, however, have a huge (and negative) impact on
building operating costs. Several desiccant-based enhanced dehu-
midification approaches can provide better space humidity control
using less energy then conventional cooling-coil-based systems.
Concerns over moisture management in HVAC system design
were brought into focus when ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62-1989,
Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, increased outdoor air
ventilation requirements by nearly four-fold. This change vividly
raised awareness of the impact of humidity control in air-condi-
tioned buildings in humid climates (Kosar et al. 1998) and led to the
emergence of many alternative cooling system designs with
enhanced dehumidification components.
The availability (since 1997) of improved design weather data
addressing humidity and dew point (Harriman et al. 1999) in the
ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals and the quantification of out-
side air dehumidification loads (Harriman et al. 1997) have made it
more straightforward to determine a building’s moisture removal
design needs, especially those originating from the introduction of
outdoor air. The updated design weather data often resulted in a
lowering of traditional dry-bulb temperatures while increasing the
latent (moisture) content of the outdoor air. The newer data allowed
for better accounting of the cooling capacity required to condition
outdoor air and also showed a need for lower sensible heat ratio
(SHR) equipment.
CHAPTER 9
SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
214⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
The problem of moisture control becomes even more challeng-
ing with “green” building designs because these buildings typically
have significantly reduced sensible loads. Electric lighting loads are
significantly lower, solar loads through glazing are usually greatly
reduced, and envelope loads in general are reduced. This results in a
situation where sensible loads are lowered but latent loads (internal
loads from people especially) are not changed. This pattern reduces
SHRs.
Taken together, these converging trends require HVAC&R sys-
tems with lower system SHRs in order to provide acceptable con-
trol of humidity. Experience has shown many HVAC systems in
non-desert climates require part-load SHRs in the 0.4 to 0.7 range
for good space humidity control. Constant volume, fan-cycling DX
systems are the most challenging for maintaining humidity control.
A number of the special systems in this section can address these
concerns. See Acker (1999) for a detailed review of dehumidifica-
tion system options and performance.
9.1.2 Cooling Coils and Dehumidification
To control humidity, a conventional cooling coil lowers the
temperature of an airstream below the supply air dew point in
order to condense water vapor into liquid that is drained away.
This is a two-step process. The first step involves only sensible
cooling (lowering the air dry-bulb temperature) and then, once the
air is saturated, the second step involves simultaneous sensible
(temperature reduction) and latent (dehumidification) cooling.
There is no way for a single coil to decouple these two (sensible
and latent) process elements.
A coil needs to cool supply air to a dew point low enough to
control the space humidity. Cooling coils are typically controlled by
a thermostat. When zone temperature control is satisfied, the unit
coil (and/or fan) is turned off. Although sensible load has been sat-
isfied, the system may not have provided the necessary dehumidifi-
cation. If the thermostatic control is overridden and zone humidity
is used to control the coil, the space will be overcooled. To avoid
subcooling under such circumstances, reheat is often applied.
Reheat using “new” energy is a very energy-intensive and wasteful
solution and is commonly prohibited by building (energy) codes.
Free reheat, however, is often available.
There are several cold-coil-related air-conditioning options that
offer better part-load SHR control. Some of these options include
VAV, dual-path coils, face and bypass dampers, and using “free
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐215
reheat” from the compressor of the chiller. Nevertheless, all of these
systems are limited by the coil leaving dew-point temperature. The
space conditions can go no lower then the supply air dew point.
Low-temperature cold-coil systems can do a good job of controlling
space dew point. The typical cold-coil system temperature is 48°F
[8.9°C] for DX/CW systems, with the potential to go to 40°F
[4.4°C] for chilled-water systems. Hospital operating rooms are a
common application for such a system.
Options such as “wrap around” series coil loops, plate heat
exchangers, and heat pipes significantly improve cold-coil part-load
dehumidification performance by precooling air before it enters the
coil and then reheating the air after leaving the coil (as shown in
Figure 9-1). Although very effective, these arrangements have the
fundamental limitation of the cold coil—the supply air dew point
can be no lower than that produced by the cooling coil.
Series sensible dehumidification is a common option for 100%
outdoor air ventilation units that produce “room neutral air,” as
operating costs for this approach are generally lower than for stan-
dard cold-coil/reheat units. Room neutral air delivered to a space,
however, often needs to be further cooled by another system. Elimi-
nating this need would lower the overall air-conditioning system
energy consumption.
9.1.3 Desiccant Systems
If humidity needs to be independently controlled and/or con-
trolled to low levels, desiccant-enhanced systems are a viable
option of increasing popularity. Desiccant dehumidifiers apply sor-
bent materials (such as silica gel) that have a high affinity for mois-
ture to remove water vapor directly from an airstream. The moisture
is held inside the porous structure of the desiccant. During the sorp-

tion process, the airstream is dried but also warmed as the desiccant
material converts the latent moisture load into a sensible heat load.
The sorption process can be reversed, with the collected moisture
inside the desiccant material being desorbed and released as a vapor
into another airstream via a regeneration process that involves heat-
ing the desiccant to a higher temperature.
Desiccants can be in solid (wheel) or liquid form. The most
common implementation of solid desiccants is in a rotary dehumid-
ifier with desiccant-matrix-impregnated channel surfaces that come
in intimate contact with the passing airstream. Most commercial
HVAC&R desiccant applications use a solid-desiccant, wheel-
based system.
9.1.4 Desiccants
A detailed review of desiccants and their properties is pre-
sented in the “Sorbents and Desiccants” chapter in the ASHRAE
Handbook—Fundamentals. The discussion that follows is limited
to highlighting certain material properties to assist in understanding
resulting desiccant dehumidifier performance. Desiccants are avail-
able in either liquid or solid form. Only the more common solid
desiccant form (used with wheels) is discussed here.
Solid desiccants (such as silica gel) can absorb anywhere from
20% to 40% of their own dry weight in moisture. These materials
utilize atomic and electrostatic forces to attract H2O molecules to
microscopic pores within their structure. The water inside the desic-
cant pores is in a sorbed state—similar in energy content to liquid
water but without its bulk properties. The desiccant material con-
verts the latent moisture load to a sensible heat load during the
sorption process. In fact, the process releases heat in an amount
somewhat greater than (~1.0 to 1.4 times) the heat of condensation.
The exact magnitude of the released energy, known as the heat of
sorption, depends in great part upon the isotherm properties of the
desiccant (which relate the equilibrium moisture content of the des-
iccant to the surrounding water vapor pressure).
Desiccant isotherms are classified by Brunauer Type, with
Types I and III representing the extremes in equilibrium relation-
ships. Type I behavior is characterized by significant moisture
uptake, even at lower water vapor pressures or at low relative
humidity on a given temperature isotherm. Type III behavior is
characterized by significant moisture uptake only at higher water
vapor pressures or at high relative humidity on a given temperature
isotherm. Type III desiccants tend to exhibit a heat of sorption close
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐217
to the heat of condensation. Type I desiccants tend to exhibit a heat
of sorption fractionally higher than the heat of condensation.
Generic desiccant isotherms are shown in Figure 9-2.
9.1.5 Parallel Desiccant Systems
Desiccant wheels can be configured in parallel or series airflow
configurations. Parallel desiccant systems have been around for
some time. A desiccant wheel rotates between a process (often a
supply) air path and a regeneration air path. The regeneration air
can be heated or unheated air that is used to drive water vapor off
the wheel. When the wheel rotates from the regeneration stream
into the process airstream, the wheel dries (and heats up) the pro-
cess air.
Heated regeneration air typically lowers the process airstream
dew point to a target value established by design requirements. In
an operating room, for example, the required dew point can be as
low as 40°F [4.4°C], which can be difficult to achieve using stan-
dard cooling coils. The regeneration air can originate from outdoor,
return, or exhaust airstreams because its conditioning capacity is
provided by the addition of heat from an external source. The heat
drives the moisture out of the desiccant medium, permitting the des-
iccant to accept more moisture from the process airstream.
Unheated regeneration air is typically discarded return or
exhaust air used to pretreat incoming outdoor air prior to further
conditioning. Unheated regeneration air has an inherent condition-

218⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
ing capacity compared to incoming outdoor air. Desiccant acts as
the medium through which this capacity is transferred from the
return/exhaust airstream to the outdoor airstream without the input
of external regeneration heat.
There are many parallel desiccant wheel configurations.
Figure 9-3 shows a parallel wheel upstream of the cold coil and
Figure 9-4 shows representative system performance at summer
design conditions.
A desiccant wheel located downstream of the cold coil can
dehumidify supply air to an equally low dew point and requires less

regeneration air upstream of cooling coil (courtesy of Trane).

recooling—perhaps none—because the leaving dry-bulb tempera-
ture is not as high. Figure 9-5 shows a parallel wheel downstream of
the cold coil and Figure 9-6 shows system typical performance.
The downstream sensible heat load produced by the parallel
desiccant dehumidification process, combined with its additional
requirement for regeneration heat, has traditionally limited its con-
sideration to special applications in industry with moisture-sensi-
tive process and storage requirements involving
•
a relative humidity (RH) of 45% or lower or
•
a dew-point temperature of 45°F [7.2°C] or lower.
Figure 9-5. Schematic showing parallel desiccant wheel downstream
of cooling coil (courtesy of Trane).
Figure 9-6. Typical performance of a downstream parallel desiccant
wheel (courtesy of Trane).
220⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
As target humidity levels go lower, desiccant dehumidifica-
tion with heated regeneration air can achieve more operating
advantages, including higher moisture removal rates per unit of
airflow, than condensation-based systems without the need to
address cooling coil icing when approaching freezing dew-point
temperatures or below.
System designs incorporating desiccant dehumidification are,
however, still evolving into energy-efficient configurations. Earlier
designs often located the desiccant dehumidifier as the first compo-
nent in the outdoor airstream to pretreat outdoor air directly. More
recent designs place the desiccant dehumidifier downstream of the
cooling coil, yielding a much more energy-efficient approach.
9.1.6 Parallel Desiccant Application Considerations
Heated regeneration in parallel desiccant applications typically
occurs between 120°F and 250°F [50°C and 120°C]. The principal
benefit of parallel desiccant drying requirements is the ability to use
“free” heat and nonrefrigerated water. Lower operating costs result
when the regeneration is not provided by expensive heat sources
(via purchased energy) but by relatively inexpensive thermal energy
resources, such as reject heat from building equipment, air-condi-
tioner desuperheater/condenser heat, or industrial waste heat
(USDOE 1999). On the cooling side, removing the heat of sorption
using nonrefrigerated water from a cooling tower, evaporatively
cooled building exhaust air, or well water is less expensive than
cold-coil removal.
Heated parallel desiccant system operating costs are greatly
impacted by the cost of the regeneration heat source. As pur-
chased energy costs (especially gas prices) rise, this will become a
key design issue. Other issues—including system control com-
plexity, multiple fans (two or three per unit), high pressure drop
across the desiccant wheel, cross-leakage, and cross-contamina-
tion—also impact system economics. Computer simulations of
building/system performance using an hour-by-hour energy anal-
ysis program with humidity storage modeling can provide insight
into system energy and life-cycle cost viability. Regardless of
energy and cost benefits, cross-contamination between the regen-
eration and process airstreams can occur, which may make desic-
cant dehumidification unsuitable for some applications (such as a
hospital operating room).
Parallel desiccant systems are competitive in special low-
humidity applications, such as pharmaceutical and electronic manu-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐221
facturing areas. Another competitive application is in dual-path sys-
tems where the parallel desiccant unit is a 100% outdoor air unit
that dries air to a 35°F to 45°F [1.7°C to 7.2°C] dew point. This dry
air generally provides all the latent cooling the building requires.
Separate systems, such as fan-coils or heat pumps, provide the nec-
essary space sensible cooling.
9.1.7 Series Desiccant Systems
Several recent innovative designs place the desiccant dehumid-
ifier wheel in series or “wrapped around” (via ducting) the cooling
coil to enhance cold-coil dehumidification performance. Some of
these series enhanced dehumidification systems now represent an
emerging best practice for achieving lower system SHR while
maintaining high COP. Series desiccant units have just one path and
typically use one duct system and one fan. Figure 9-7 shows an air
handler with a series desiccant wheel.
A Type 3 desiccant wheel rotates between the coil-entering and
the coil-leaving airstreams. In a mixed-air unit, the incoming air
(see Figure 9-8) to the first stage of the wheel (MA) regenerates the
wheel (MA′). When the wheel rotates into the supply airstream
downstream of the cooling coil (CA), the wheel dries the air and
provides some reheat (SA). The cold air latent and sensible capaci-
ties are more balanced, giving a typical SHR of 0.5. The CA supply
air is significantly drier than would be the case simply considering
the coil temperature. Without the wheel, the cold coil would have to
be at temperature CA and then be reheated to point SA.
Compared to cold-coil systems, the principal benefit of series
desiccants is a reduction in the air-side energy (smaller cooling
coils), a lower refrigeration load, and reduced electrical consump-
Figure 9-7. Series desiccant wheel configuration (courtesy of Trane).
222⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
tion for the refrigeration equipment due to the higher coil leaving
air temperature. This arrangement is a fairly simple system.
Series wheel regeneration can occur at any temperature, as
long as there is a significant difference in the relative humidity
between the return (or mixed) air and the supply air. Typical regen-
eration temperatures are in the 60°F to 80°F [16°C to 27°C] range.
Series desiccant systems typically provide good payback when the
desired space dew-point temperature is in the 25°F to 50°F [–4°C to
10°C] range.
Series desiccant wheels are split 50/50 to keep air-side pressure
drops low (typically around 0.5 to 1 in. w.g. [125 to 249 Pa] static
pressure). Wheel control is from a space humidistat; if above the set-
point, the wheel is on, and if below the setpoint, the wheel is off. A
series wheel can be configured for 100% outdoor air, but a good
energy-saving idea is to add an energy wheel as shown in Figure 9-9.
Depending upon the outside climate, this arrangement can reduce
the coil loading up to 30%.
Series desiccant wheels can be provided as an enhancement to
a standard rooftop system or air handler. The system can be incor-
porated into either a constant volume or VAV system. As a one-duct
system it is easy to integrate into standard unit controls. Depending
Figure 9-8. Mixed-air series desiccant system performance (courtesy
of Trane).
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐223
upon the cold-coil temperature, series desiccant wheels can dry the
supply air to the 30 to 50 gr/lb [4.3 to 7.2 g/kg] range. This low
humidity level can generally provide all the latent cooling a build-
ing requires.
Return air relative humidity is a concern with this system
arrangement. If the RH is too high to absorb water, a lower cold-
coil temperature or a first pass wheel preheat to lower the incoming
relative humidity will be needed. This preheat wheel can use “free”
condenser heat, but it does add coil load and, thus, should be
avoided wherever possible.
9.1.8 Series Desiccant Applications
Series desiccant systems are typically used in all-air system
applications—including, among others, operating rooms, museums
and archives, supermarkets, and schools.
As with parallel configurations, a computer analysis of the
HVAC&R system and building using an hour-by-hour energy simu-
lation program that incorporates humidity storage modeling is nec-
essary to determine system payback. Such analysis must include all
relevant systems in the building and address overall, as well as com-
ponent, energy consumption and capacity.

systems, see the “Desiccant Dehumidification and Pressure Drying

9.2 THERMAL STORAGE
9.2.1 General
Energy efficiency can involve using less energy, but it can also
mean using energy more effectively. Thermal storage allows cool-
ing to be produced at night for use the following day (typically dur-
ing times of peak demand). This improves efficiency for utilities
because it allows them to service more customers with the same
generating capacity and/or flatten out their production profiles. The
resulting lower cost of utility operation can be passed on to custom-
ers in the form of lower rates—particularly for off-peak consump-
tion. See Section 2.8.5 for a discussion of utility rates. Thermal
storage, as such, is not necessarily an energy-efficiency measure
but, rather, a cost-saving technique. It can save the building opera-
tor money in several ways:
•
By decreasing or eliminating chiller operation during utility
peak periods, demand charges are reduced.
•
By displacing energy use from peak to off-peak periods, a
lower energy charge may be incurred.
•
Some electric utilities promote thermal storage by offering an
incentive for displaced power, which can amount to several
hundred dollars for each kilowatt moved from peak to off-peak
demand.
It is wise to investigate whether thermal storage can be advan-
tageous for a particular project. Among the applications most favor-
able to thermal storage are buildings with high cooling demands of
short duration, additions to existing buildings, and projects in the
service area of utilities with generation capacity problems and, con-
sequently, high demand charges. It is critical that the load patterns
of a building considered for a thermal storage installation will not
change significantly. If a church is designed for intermittent use
with thermal storage, it may not be suitable for future use as a
round-the-clock emergency shelter. Consider also that future utility
rate changes can alter the operating economics of thermal storage.
Of course, this statement applies to many system selection deci-
sions where uncertainty plays a role.
For a more detailed discussion of thermal storage, see the “Ther-
mal Storage” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐225
9.2.2 Design-Day Cooling Load
Thermal storage systems require a different method of cooling
load analysis. In systems without thermal storage, only the maxi-
mum instantaneous cooling load is calculated for system sizing pur-
poses. Capacity-control devices then allow the refrigeration plant to
follow the building load profile during periods of lower demand.
No analysis of daily cooling loads is necessary (unless for energy
consumption estimates). With thermal storage systems, however,
the cooling requirement for every hour of the design day must be
calculated. In Figure 9-10 for example, the base load is seen to vary
from 13 tons [46 kW] at 8:00 a.m. to 20 tons [70 kW] between noon
and 6:00 p.m. After some lighting and air handlers are turned off,
the load drops to 10 tons [35 kW] until the cooling systems are shut
off at 8:00 p.m. At this point, the daily load would appear to inte-
grate to 205 ton-hours [720 kW-hours].
It would be a mistake, however, to assume that this represents
the entire cooling load. In reality, there are continuing loads of three
types. One originates from continuously operating heat sources
such as emergency lighting and plug loads such as computers. The
second derives from thermal mass (concrete floors, walls, and fur-
niture), which absorbs radiant heat from lighting and solar radiation
and releases it during unoccupied periods. The third involves mois-
Figure 9-10. Variation of cooling load during the day.
226⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
ture flows from outdoor air (unless completely shut off) and from
moisture stored in building materials and furnishings (not yet a
well-documented phenomenon). These loads must be removed
from the building prior to occupancy. They are usually handled with
a precooling/predehumidifying cycle that starts the cooling plant
before occupants arrive. In this example, the aggregate of these heat
gains is calculated to be 35 ton-hours [123 kW-hours]. The total
daily cooling load is therefore 205 + 35 or 240 ton-hours [720 +
123 = 843 kW-hours]. Only now can the designer begin to select a
thermal storage solution.
9.2.3 Design of Storage and Cooling Plant
A conventional refrigeration system requires a unit with suffi-
cient capacity to handle the largest cooling load and a capacity con-
trol arrangement to handle all lesser loads. From Figure 9-11, a
20 ton [70 kW] unit starting at 6:00 a.m. and following the cooling
load profile would manage the load until the refrigeration system is
shut off at 8 p.m. Each square under the cooling load profile repre-
Figure 9-11. Cooling equipment operation options to match the
instantaneous load of Figure 9-10.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐227
sents one ton-hour [3.5 kW-hour]. By counting squares, it can be
seen that the cooling system must provide 240 ton-hours [843 kW-
hours] during the day. A 20 ton [70 kW] capacity unit operating
over 14 hours is one solution. A 10 ton [35 kW] unit operating
through 24 hours, however, can also provide the needed capacity.
Trying to cover the daily cooling load with a 10 ton [35 kW]
unit requires 100 ton-hours [350 kW-hours] of stored cooling
between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. to help the smaller sized cooling
unit deal with the load. This new distribution of cooling capacity
may not be the least expensive, but it accomplishes a useful func-
tion by reducing electricity demand, since a 10 ton [35 kW] unit
will use less power during the time of peak demand than a 20 ton
[70 kW] unit. This system is referred to as partial storage because
it is only large enough to help an under-peak-sized cooling unit get
through the day.
If a refrigeration plant needs to be shut down entirely during
the daytime to avoid high demand charges, the storage must be
enlarged to handle the entire cooling load, as shown in Figure 9-12.
Figure 9-12. Cooling equipment off-peak operation to satisfy load of
Figure 9-10.
228⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
Now the system is referred to as full storage because it can store the
entire daily cooling demand of 240 ton-hours [843 kW-hours]. If
the electric utility’s peak period lasts from 6:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m.,
ten hours are left for the cooling unit to generate the full storage. In
this case, the refrigeration unit would need a capacity of
240 ton-hours/10 hours, which equals 24 tons [843 kW-hours/
10 hours = 85 kW]. In this case, which is typical, full storage is
costlier to install than partial storage because both the refrigeration
plant and the storage are larger.
Storage is particularly viable when serving cooling loads of
short duration. It is critical to the success of this approach that loads
be accurately assessed during design. Figure 9-13 illustrates the load
profile for a church that requires 300 ton-hours [1055 kW-hours] of
cooling for the entire week. Conventionally, this would require a
75 ton [265 kW] unit operating for four hours on Sunday morning. If
storage were provided, a 2 ton [7 kW] ice builder operating continu-
Figure 9-13. Typical cooling load profile for a church.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐229
ously could serve the load with 36 ton-hours [125 kW-hours]
remaining for storage losses from the ice/chilled-water tank
(Figure 9-14). This solution not only reduces electric demand but
may reduce initial cost as well. Also, consider that the three-phase
service required to drive a 75 ton [265 kW] unit may not be available
in some neighborhoods.
Another situation might involve a coliseum that can be main-
tained in the comfort zone without people or lighting using
200 tons [700 kW] of cooling but which requires 2000 tons
[7035 kW] operating for four hours to serve 25,000 people during
concerts (Figure 9-15). The conventional approach would involve
the purchase of 2000 tons [7035 kW] of refrigeration to operate
four hours per day at full load and 20 hours per day at 10% capac-
ity. A thermal storage approach would manage the same
12,000 ton-hour [42,200 kW-hour] daily requirement less expen-
sively with a 500 ton [1760 kW] cooling plant operating around
the clock.
9.2.4 Sizing and Location of Storage Tanks
Storage tanks of 50,000 gallons [190,000 L] or less are usually
constructed of steel or reinforced plastic. Larger tanks are generally
constructed more inexpensively of concrete. The cost of the tank is
an important consideration for water storage systems because of the
Figure 9-14. Thermal storage installed in a church.
230⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
large volume required. Storage volume is a function of the amount
of cooling to be stored. This often works out to be between 0.5 and
1.0 gal per ft2 [20 and 40 L per m2] of conditioned space for water
storage and to about 25% of that capacity for ice storage. Because
of its bulk and weight, storage is frequently located in or under a
basement or next to a building. On the other hand, “topside” storage
eliminates the energy required to transfer chilled water from open
storage containers into basement piping circuits pressurized by the
static head of the building (see the “Thermal Storage” chapter in the
ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications).
9.2.5 Chilled-Water Storage Circuitry and Control
Figure 9-16 shows the elements of an appropriate control sys-
tem for chilled-water storage. Once the demand limiter has been set
for the chiller, it provides chilled water at a constant temperature
but at some fraction of full-capacity flow. The demand-limiting
device forces the control valve to shift more flow to bypass. This
reduces the inlet temperature to the chiller and causes it to operate
using less energy. The balance of the chilled water required by the
load is drawn from storage. System demand for chilled water is
based upon the position of throttling valves at the coils. These, in
turn, may be controlled by thermostats in the airstream leaving the
coils. The total flow is regulated by a pressurestat, which controls
the pump with a variable-speed motor or bypass control. In some
cases, there may be an override control to maintain the temperature
Figure 9-15. Typical cooling load for sports arena.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐231
of water returning to storage. As shown, the controls maintain the
design supply and return water temperature to ensure that the stor-
age retains its rated capacity. The pressure-sustaining valve should
be controlled from a pressurestat located at the high point of the
system and set for some minimum positive pressure, such as 5 psi
[240 Pa].
9.2.6 Ice Storage Concepts
The idea of chilling water and storing it in tanks is straightfor-
ward. By comparison, techniques for ice storage are more varied
and complex. One widely applied ice storage system consists of
refrigerated pipe coils submerged in a water tank. During charging,
ice builds on the coils, and during discharge, chilled water circulat-
ing through the tank melts the ice. Another type of ice storage mod-
ule is made so that it can be frozen and thawed by circulating brine
through coils in cylindrical water tanks. Advantages claimed for
Figure 9-16. Control schematic for typical chilled-water storage sys-
232⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
this technique include the fact that melting and refreezing always
take place adjacent to the piping instead of remote from it. Other
types of ice storage consist of harvester or shucker ice packages,
which generate ice to be stored in an insulated ice bin. Ice is frozen
to a thickness of approximately 3/16 in. [5 mm] on refrigeration
plates that are up to 7 ft [2.1 m] long. A defrost cycle releases the
ice, which then drops into a storage tank. As far as the refrigeration
cycle is concerned, this type of equipment can be packaged in sizes
up to 400 tons [1400 kW]. The tank can be of any size to suit the
process. Illustrations and operating cycles for these and other ice
storage types are found in the “Thermal Storage” chapter in the
ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications.
9.2.7 Economic Analysis of Storage Options
Analysis of the design-day cooling load profile shown in previ-
ous sections is sufficient to determine tentative values for storage
and cooling plant sizing, as illustrated in the examples given above.
A more thorough analysis, however, is required to determine the
economic feasibility of a thermal storage project. This is preferably
done using hour-by-hour analysis over an entire year, taking into
account the applicable electric utility rates. As a minimum, the
analysis must include consideration of a representative day for each
of the four seasons because optimum use of cool storage requires a
strategy to minimize the electric demand of the chiller during peak
periods. Therefore, storage operation varies from month to month
as a function of the daily cooling load profile and the monthly util-
ity billing demand, which is not necessarily identical to the actual
monthly peak demand. The entire electric demand of a building
(not just the cooling plant demand) must be included in economic
calculations to obtain the optimum trade-off point between chiller
and storage size.
For example, Figure 9-17 illustrates a 500 ton [1760 kW]
chiller managing a 12,000 ton-hour [42,200 kW-hour] cooling load
on the hottest day of the year. The chiller and 7000 ton-hours
[24,620 kW-hours] of storage are both being used to full capacity.
In October, the maximum cooling day requires only 9000 ton-hours
[31,650 kW-hours] (Figure 9-18). Thus, if the storage is used to its
full extent, the chiller can be limited to only 200 tons [700 kW] of
input capacity. It would be normal to leave the chiller at the 200 ton
[700 kW] setting for other October days with lesser cooling
requirements because the chiller demand has already been created,
and the more cooling that is generated and directed to load, the less
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐233
is lost through storage. For these lower-load days, the operator
would precharge the storage only as much as needed to get through
the day, since partial precharging helps to limit storage losses. An
exception to this procedure would involve daily use of the entire
storage when off-peak rates were sufficiently lower (by, for exam-
ple, 2¢/kWh or more) to overcome the penalty of transfer pumping
energy. In January, this partial storage system may be operated as
full storage since the maximum cooling demand may be less than
can be generated entirely off peak (Figure 9-19).
Some designers combine ice storage with a low-temperature
air distribution system (see Section 9.3.8) to take advantage of the
Figure 9-17. A 500 ton [1760 kW] chiller and partial storage satisfying
12,000 ton-hour [42,200 kW-hour] demand on summer design day.

lower air temperature available from ice storage. Bhansali and Hit-
tle (1990) compared a variety of VAV systems with economizer
cycles in five climates under four different utility tariffs. In spite of
additional energy use (20% to 45%), the combination of ice storage
and cold air resulted in lower annual utility costs than ice storage
with conventional-temperature air, or regular chiller operation with
conventional air or with cold air, for all cases investigated. Chillers
will operate at a lower COP (higher kW/ton [kW/kW]) while mak-
ing ice because of the required lower supply temperatures.
9.3 ENERGY-EFFICIENT SUBSYSTEMS
9.3.1 Introduction
In earlier times of plentiful and cheap energy, HVAC designers
found it expedient to plan systems with generous air circulation
rates to maintain a good sense of air movement for occupants. They
also provided generous ventilation rates for the dilution of airborne
contaminants. Less thought was given to achieving these effects
with the least possible energy use because energy costs constituted
a relatively small part of a building’s operating budget. The energy
disruptions of the 1970s led to a fundamental reappraisal of the role
of energy use in buildings and how to design new systems to mini-
mize energy use.
Pre-energy-crisis commercial buildings were found to be con-
suming anywhere from 60,000 to 300,000 Btu/ft2 yr [682,000 to
3,408,000 kJ/m2 yr] with an average of, perhaps, 160,000 Btu/ft2 yr
[1,818,000 kJ/m2 yr]. Pursuit of energy-efficiency modifications
subsequent to the 1970s reduced this to around 40,000 to
Figure 9-19. A 500 ton (1760 kW) chiller operating with full storage on
a winter day.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐235
150,000 Btu/ft2 yr [454,400 to 1,704,000 kJ/m2 yr]. New buildings
are typically targeted in the range of 30,000 to 85,000 Btu/ft2 yr
[341,000 to 956,000 kJ/m2 yr] depending upon building type and
design intent. The specifics of building energy use are climate-,
function-, and design-specific and are fairly dynamic. Reductions in
building energy use seem to have leveled off recently, and substan-
tial improvements in lighting efficiency have been supplanted by
increased plug loads. In any event, HVAC&R systems are responsi-
ble for a good percentage of building energy consumption—
accounting for perhaps 40% of primary energy consumption. To
understand the design philosophy of energy efficiency, it is useful
to examine what was wasteful about older designs, what has been
done to improve existing systems, and what is considered appropri-
ate for new systems.
It is energy efficient to allow the space temperature to rise above
design conditions in the summer and float downward in the winter
during unoccupied hours. This may be done simply by resetting the
zone thermostat (or temperature sensor) automatically or manually.
When there are a number of zones in a building, however, some of
which are occupied while others are unoccupied, a more complex
control system is required. Modular equipment, variable-speed fans
and pumps, reset controls for hot and chilled water, zone control
valves or mixing boxes, and unitary equipment are options to
accommodate varying occupancy profiles or varying loads due to the
exterior environment or building use. In humid climates, control of
space dew point during off-cycle periods should be considered.
Uncontrolled off-cycle humidity can potentially lead to mold/mil-
dew problems and/or duct sweating during system start-up.
9.3.2 Simple Systems
Many constant-volume systems were set up to both heat and
cool a zone (Figure 9-20). Cooling could be provided totally by out-
door air when the exterior air temperature was below 55°F
[12.8°C], with help from mechanical refrigeration between 55°F
and 70°F [12.8°C and 21.1°C], and by refrigeration alone above
70°F [21.1°C]. While this system offered comfort for occupants, it
wasted heating energy when the room conditions were such that
55°F [12.8°C] air proved to be too cold and the heating coil was
activated to increase the supply air temperature to maintain com-
fort—thus, this system arrangement is no longer permitted by most
energy codes. Figure 9-21 illustrates how a room thermostat can be
modified to control the mixed air directly. This avoids overcooling
236⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
the zone and eliminates the parasitic heating inherent in the system
control depicted in Figure 9-20.
9.3.3 Discriminating Temperature Controls
In Figure 9-22, a ductstat (a thermostat located inside a duct)
sequences outdoor air (economizer operation) and then mechanical
cooling to maintain a low, base supply air temperature to a reheat sys-
Figure 9-20. Schematic of conventional HVAC system.
Figure 9-21. HVAC system modified to eliminate parasitic heating.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐237
tem serving more than one zone. Reheat coils respond to zone ther-
mostats to increase this base supply air temperature, if required, to
match the actual cooling requirement in each zone. The problem with
this scheme is similar to that with the previous one—most of the time
many of the zones will likely not require air as cold as the base sup-
ply air temperature, which was selected to meet a maximum zone
design condition. A solution to reduce reheat use is to “discriminate”
the supply air temperature to respond to feedback from the zone ther-
mostats, as is seen in Figure 9-23. The supply air temperature will
now be provided only as low as the temperature required for the zone
with the greatest cooling load. Parasitic reheat will be a fraction of
what it was with a fixed supply temperature control.
This concept of discriminating controls applies equally well to
most basic HVAC systems. For example, multizone deck tempera-
tures need be only as high or as low as demanded by the greatest
zone requirement for heating or cooling. The hot and cold supply
temperatures of a double-duct system need only deviate from room
temperature as required by the greatest call for heating and cool-
ing—a situation usually marked by an extreme valve or damper
position in one of the many zones. The air and water temperatures
for all systems should be responsive to feedback from zone controls
so that the least possible energy is required to provide comfort. In
this way, flexible zone temperature control can be provided with a
minimum of parasitic heating and cooling.
9.3.4 Eliminating Energy Waste in Simple Systems
An ideal HVAC&R system would use the least possible energy
for air and water circulation and generate only the amount of heat-
ing and cooling necessary to offset space heat losses and gains.
Figure 9-22. Conventional temperature control.
238⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
Reheat energy for temperature control, used extensively in the past,
would be eliminated because it adds to both heating and cooling
requirements. How can such an ideal system be constituted?
First, the amount of air and water circulated should be only that
needed, at any given instant, to convey the heating or cooling energy
required to meet the loads of a space. This statement involves two
cautions. It is wise to circulate adequate air to provide occupants
with a sensation of air movement—a minimum of 2 air changes per
hour is often considered appropriate. In addition, outdoor air as
specified by Standard 62.1 (or 62.2) must be provided to ensure
acceptable indoor air quality. Above these comfort and indoor air
quality minimum air changes, circulation rates will vary to match
fluctuating loads. Second, the heat generated must be only enough to
serve the aggregate zone heating loads, and the cooling generated
must be only enough to serve the aggregate zone cooling loads. If
these concepts are applied to the simple system shown in Figure
9-20, the zone thermostat would reduce the volume of air being cir-
culated as the zone temperature is satisfied. This would optimize fan
energy consumption. When the minimum acceptable air change
value is reached, the thermostat would have the ability to adjust the
supply air conditions so that the space is not overcooled. Care needs
to be applied to be sure that the adjusted supply air conditions can
control both the space temperature and humidity in the summer.
Designers may recognize a flaw in the above because air that is
not cooled to around 55°F [12.8°C] may carry too much moisture to
be able to maintain a desired space relative humidity of 55% or less.
Figure 9-24 illustrates control modifications that act to conserve fan
energy while preserving minimum air circulation and a satisfactory
relative humidity in a space. The return air bypass ensures that no

AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐239
moisture-laden outdoor air circumvents the cooling coil. Variable
supply airflow allows reductions in fan energy down to a defined
minimum rate of air circulation. In this scenario, mechanical cool-
ing would be initiated when the outdoor air temperature rose to
above 55°F [12.8°C]. As space temperature drops below setpoint,
the thermostat would first throttle the volume of 55°F [12.8°C] air
to the minimum setting and then raise the supply air temperature by
opening the return air bypass. The air mixing and bypass air damp-
ers must be provided with the minimum outdoor air volume for
acceptable indoor air quality.
9.3.5 Eliminating Reheat in Multizone Systems
Historically, the multizone HVAC system has wasted substan-
tial energy. In many cases, deck temperatures were permanently set
to satisfy the greatest winter heating requirement and the greatest
summer cooling requirement. Automatic discrimination of deck
temperatures to suit real-time zone demands can do much to reduce
parasitic losses related to the mixing of airstreams at unnecessary
temperatures, but total elimination of cooling and heating waste can
only be achieved by adding a bypass deck to each zone, as shown in
Figure 9-25. The zones are now able to modify the deck tempera-
ture to suit the requirement of the highest zone demand. In addition,
the bypass deck eliminates the mixing of hot and cold air. The zone
thermostat can call, in sequence, for full hot air, a hot air and bypass
mix, full bypass, a cold air and bypass mix, and full cold air.
9.3.6 Eliminating Parasitic Heating in VAV Systems
In the past, VAV systems have saved fan energy, but not with-
out countervailing side effects. When the supply of 55°F [12.8°C]
Figure 9-24. Control modifications for energy efficiency.
240⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
air to interior zones is reduced to match space cooling loads, the
supply volume may be reduced below the minimum air change rate,
leading to air quality complaints. An antidote, involving reheat of
the minimum supply air volume, is also counterproductive with
respect to energy efficiency. When 55°F [12.8°C] air is supplied to
perimeter zones, it must be reheated to room temperature in winter
before it is heated further to overcome envelope heat losses. The
heat input to take air from 55°F [12.8°C] to room temperature is
parasitic. One way to overcome this is to supply air that is thermo-
statically controlled for each solar exposure. At the least, this
implies separate air supply zoning for interior, south-facing perime-
ter, and other perimeter zones. For compartmented air-handling
systems, the air unit can be configured as shown in Figure 9-26.
Another popular solution is to add a fan to each air terminal, as
shown in Figure 9-27. The side-pocket fan in the air terminal is
sized to provide the desired minimum rate of air circulation. It is
run only when the primary air supply falls below this critical value.
Reheating 55°F [12.8°C] air supply to perimeter zones can be
avoided by ensuring that perimeter heat is not activated until the
cold air damper is at its minimum setting. Since the addition of
fans in a plenum space means that maintenance of bearings and
filters will occur in occupied spaces, the same effect can be
achieved using one central fan for each floor or major zone. This
central fan then recirculates air at a neutral temperature to
dual-duct-type terminals connected jointly to the cold air supply
and the neutral air supply. Perimeter air terminals can have

optional heating coils, which are activated only after the cold air
damper is at its minimum setting.
9.3.7 Economizer Cycle (Free Cooling)
Air-handling systems that have access to 100% outdoor air can
provide full cooling without the assistance of mechanical refrigera-
tion whenever the outdoor dry-bulb air temperature is lower than
the required supply air temperature. Such an air-side economizer

Figure 9-27. Air terminal with side-pocket fan.
242⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
cycle (Figure 9-28), which is most effective in northern climates, is
capable of saving up to 70% of mechanical refrigeration energy. In
southern climates, such as Florida, an air-side economizer is seldom
used. This is because the number of hours (especially occupied
building hours) during which the outdoor temperature falls below
the controlled space temperature is insufficient to justify the invest-
ment in a relief fan, air-mixing chambers, and louvers necessary to
dissipate the building pressurization caused by supplying 100%
outdoor air during economizer operation.
Energy savings can be achieved with an air-side economizer
cycle via the following sequences:
•
The outdoor air temperature is lower than the supply air tem-
perature required to meet the space-cooling load; compressors
and chilled-water pumps are turned off; and outdoor air, return
air, and exhaust/relief air dampers are positioned to attain the
required supply air temperature.
•
The outdoor air temperature is higher than the required supply
air temperature but is lower than the return air temperature;
compressor and chilled-water pumps are energized; and the
dampers are positioned for 100% outdoor air. Outdoor air and
mechanical cooling provide the desired supply air temperature.
•
The outdoor air temperature exceeds the return air temperature
(dry-bulb economizer control) or the enthalpy of the outdoor
air exceeds the enthalpy of the return air (enthalpy economizer
Figure 9-28. Air-side economizer cycle.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐243
control); the dampers are positioned to bring in the minimum
outdoor air required for acceptable indoor air quality.
To be truly effective, control of air-side economizer cycles
should not be based solely upon dry-bulb temperature conditions—
but upon enthalpy, as illustrated in Figures 9-29 and 9-30 (Dubin
and Long 1978). Enthalpy controls in the past have been difficult to
keep in calibration because they must accurately sense temperature
and humidity for optimum control. Because of this, many air-side
economizer cycles have been scheduled to revert to a minimum set-
ting for ventilation when the dry-bulb temperature reaches 80°F
[26.7°C] (or an even lower value), depending upon local conditions
of temperature and humidity. However, recent advancements in the
Figure 9-29. Dry-bulb temperature economizer cycle.
Figure 9-30. Enthalpy economizer cycle.
244⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
sensing of outdoor humidity have improved the reliability of
enthalpy controls, and their usage has become more common.
Air-handling systems that lack reasonable potential for 100%
outdoor air circulation may adopt a water-side-based winter
free-cooling approach by interconnecting the chilled-water circuit
with the cooling tower. This can be done without a heat
exchanger—but at the risk of pipe corrosion, more expensive water
treatment, and eventual degradation of system components. The
strainer shown in Figure 9-31 can effectively remove airborne dirt
from the tower discharge, but oxygen, which is added to the water
by the tower action, will be damaging to the chilled-water piping
circuit. This is generally an unacceptable risk, leading to the use of
a heat exchanger to separate the chilled-water circuit from the cool-
ing tower circuit. This adds first cost for the heat exchanger and
reduces the effectiveness of water-side cooling because of the addi-
tional Δt imposed by the heat exchanger but is generally a reason-
able trade-off considering the potential effects of not using a heat
exchanger. In most climates, water-side economizers will usually
not prove as energy conserving as air-side economizers. They do,
however, have application in high-rise buildings, where restrictions
on shaft space may preclude air-side economizers, and in spaces
(such as data centers and cleanrooms) requiring higher than normal
(say, 45%–50%) wintertime relative humidity, where energy sav-

AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐245
ings from an air-side economizer would be offset by increased con-
sumption of energy for humidification.
Another form of reduced-energy cooling involves purging
conditioned areas with cool night air prior to occupancy the fol-
lowing morning. This can avoid the use of mechanical cooling
energy to overcome the heat buildup from emergency/custodial
lighting, 24-hour plug loads, and heat released to the conditioned
spaces that was stored during the day (including solar radiation and
radiant heat from lighting fixtures). This purging cycle is highly
effective in dry climates with low nighttime temperatures, such as
in the southwestern United States, and has been used successfully
even in the Pacific Northwest (Ashley and Reynolds 1994).
9.3.8 Cold Air Supply Systems
Conventional HVAC systems are based upon a design supply
air temperature of around 55°F [12.8°C] to ensure a relative humid-
ity of 50% at a room air temperature of 75°F [23.9°C]. The advent
of ice storage and the ever-increasing cost of air distribution have
alerted designers to the potential of supplying less air at a lower
temperature. Supply air temperatures can be obtained as close as
5°F [2.8°C] to the primary coolant temperature. In the case of water
chillers, 40°F [4.5°C] water can provide 45°F [7.2°C] supply air. In
the case of an ice-based storage system, the 36°F to 38°F [2.2°C to
3.3°C] coolant can produce air supply temperatures of 41°F to 43°F
[5.0°C to 6.1°C]. Design information for supplying cold air in con-
junction with ice storage is given in the “Thermal Storage” chapter
in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Applications. Such cold supply
air must be tempered with room air to prevent cold drafts. If this is
done in fan-powered boxes that operate continuously, some of the
energy savings are lost. Supply outlets that provide for substantial
induction of room (secondary) air are an energy-efficient alterna-
tive. If the cold supply air causes system surfaces to be cooled
below the ambient dew point, the surfaces must be insulated; this
includes air handlers, ducts, and terminal boxes. Since leakage from
cold air ducts aggravates any condensation problems, all such ducts
should be reliably sealed. Condensation problems during system
start-up (following shutdowns) can be reduced by lowering the sup-
ply temperature gradually.
According to the ASHRAE comfort chart (Figure 3-1), the
lower relative humidity generated with cold air means that space
dry-bulb temperature setpoints can be increased up to 1°F [0.6°C]
for the same occupant comfort response. To ensure full cooling and
246⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
dehumidification, face velocities at cooling coils supplying cold air
should be in the 350 to 450 fpm [1.78 to 2.29 m/s] range, with an
absolute maximum of 550 fpm [2.79 m/s] (Dorgan 1989). Some
designers have suggested higher upper limits for face velocities—
with typical values of 500–550 fpm [2.55–2.79 m/s] and 600 fpm
[3.06 m/s] as a maximum. In spaces with high sensible heat ratios
(SHR), cold air systems may produce undesirably low relative
humidities. A system to remedy this situation uses cold air to satisfy
the latent cooling load and supplies additional sensible cooling
through 55°F to 60°F [12.8°C to 15.6°C] chilled-water coils at the
mixing boxes. Operating a chiller to supply chilled water at that
temperature is very efficient, and a need for additional chilled-water
piping can be eliminated by using the fire sprinkler piping (insu-
lated to prevent condensation) to supply the chilled-water coils.
Meckler (1988) notes that this has been permitted by NFPA Stan-
dard 13, Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems. The
currency of this provision should be checked with the local author-
ity having jurisdiction.
The use of temperatures lower than 55°F [12.8°C] for supply
air permits the use of smaller ducts and fans. The reduced ceiling
space required for smaller ducts can result in significant building
height savings in high-rise buildings. Perform an analysis to select
an appropriate discharge air temperature, based upon a comparative
economic analysis of the entire building, not just the HVAC&R sys-
tem. Such an analysis must consider first-cost savings from smaller
equipment, a somewhat smaller air distribution system, and a
potentially lower building height in high-rise applications;
increases in first cost for a chiller that operates at a lower tempera-
ture; increased operating costs from powered mixing boxes; and
reduced operating costs from lower air and water mass flow rates
(Dorgan 1989).
9.3.9 Water-Side Efficiency Opportunities
Savings are available from variable-flow pumping of chilled
water and condenser water and variable-speed tower fans. Water
chillers can benefit from variable-speed compressor motors and
variable supply water temperatures when air-handling systems
operate at partial loads. Chillers can also be designed to accept a
lower condensing water temperature than the conventional 85°F
[29.4°C], when available, to reduce the thermodynamic head on the
compressor. Check with the chiller manufacturer to determine the
lowest acceptable condenser water temperature and specify operat-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐247
ing controls accordingly. The combination of compressor motor,
condenser-water pump motor, and tower fan motor has historically
been assumed to require one kilowatt input for each ton [3.5 kW] of
output. Variable temperature and variable-speed controls enable
this value to be virtually halved at part-load conditions for typical
cooling applications.
9.3.10 Bootstrap Heating
Another form of low-cost heating can be used in winter by
operating a chiller to handle cooling loads in interior spaces and
using the warm condenser water thus generated to offset perimeter
heat losses. This is especially the case for a facility that includes
high internal loads (often process-based), which requires cooling all
year. It might seem counterproductive to use any form of “electri-
cal” heating when other, less expensive fuels are available. If prop-
erly operated, however, a water chiller can act as a heat pump with a
COP of up to 6. In this situation, heat reclaim may be less than half
as expensive as the next cheapest fuel. Additional piping and con-
trols are necessary to interface heating and cooling circuitry and to
add additional condenser tubing for clean heat exchange. Consider
these extra costs when conducting an analysis of savings available
from bootstrapping waste interior heat. Heating coils need to be
much larger because hot water supply temperatures are much lower
(105°F–115°F [41°C–46°C]) than those of conventional heating
systems. Potential savings must be estimated and incorporated into
a life-cycle cost analysis that includes estimated additional costs.
A “heat-pump chiller” should be operated only to provide the
cooling capacity actually required by the building spaces. If a
chiller must be false-loaded at low capacities to generate adequate
heat, much of the bootstrap system operating economy will be lost.
Control of a heat-pump chiller must be compatible with an econo-
mizer cycle. In other words, the mixed-air temperature (or
enthalpy), which determines the percentage of outdoor air, should
be set to permit the cooling coil to extract the heat required by the
perimeter circuits. The balance of the cooling is then performed
with outdoor air, while the heat pump operation boosts the heat
removed from the cooling coil to a useful heating temperature.
Buildings have occupied and unoccupied periods. During each
period, there is a balance point at some outdoor temperature where
heat gains (including the electrical input to the heat-pump chiller)
balance heat losses. Figures 9-32 and 9-33 indicate how such bal-
ance-point temperatures can be determined. They also illustrate the
248⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
range of temperatures over which heat can be salvaged and usefully
transferred and where supplementary heat may be required. The
bulk heat that can be bootstrapped at low cost can be analyzed and
aggregated with hour-by-hour or bin-type energy analysis pro-
grams. The result can then be compared with the additional invest-
ment in hardware required to implement the concept.
Figure 9-34 illustrates a form of control that allows a heat-
pump water chiller to draw heat from interior zone cooling coils to
the extent required to satisfy heating loads. Condensing water tem-
peratures should be established in the 90°F to 105°F [32°C to 41°C]
range for heating. Sufficient heating element surface needs to be
provided so that such relatively low-temperature water can satisfy
Figure 9-32. Heat balance in a perimeter space.
Figure 9-33. Heat gain and heat loss for an interior space.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐249
the space heating loads. This seldom creates an investment penalty
when the coils also provide for cooling, as with induction units and
fan-coil units.
The chiller size required for reclaim heating is often less than
one-third the size required for cooling. This may validate a
two-chiller selection, with a one-third-capacity chiller operating for
heating and both units operating for maximum cooling. Centrifugal
chillers experience some difficulty operating at low capacity with
higher condensing temperatures. Thus, chillers for heat pump duty
should be selected with care and kept as fully loaded as possible.
9.3.11 Heat Reclaim/Exchange
There are normally several opportunities for the exchange of
heat from an exiting fluid (air or water) to an entering fluid (also air
or water) in the typical building. Many of these opportunities are
cost-effective and can improve building energy efficiency. Air-to-
air heat exchangers (Section 9.4.2) are an example of a commonly
encountered heat-reclaim system. See the “Applied Heat Pump and
Figure 9-34. Control schematic for heat-pump water chiller using heat
from interior zones to satisfy heating demands in perimeter zones.
250⏐ SPECIAL HVAC SYSTEMS
Heat Recovery Systems” chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook—
HVAC Systems and Equipment for examples of such systems and
their associated equipment. An increasing designer and owner
interest in combined heat and power (CHP) systems brings the
potential for more opportunities for beneficial heat reclaim.
9.4 “GREEN” HVAC SYSTEMS
A recent (and likely ongoing and expanding) interest in “green”
HVAC&R systems (see, for example, the ASHRAE GreenGuide) has
focused attention on a number of HVAC&R system strategies that
are seen to support the intents and expectations of green design.
Ground-source heat pumps, air-to-air heat exchangers, and under-
floor air distribution are among these strategies. Each of these strate-
gies is addressed in general in the ASHRAE Handbooks and in detail
in various ASHRAE special publications. The purpose of this sec-
tion is simply to outline these strategies.
9.4.1 Ground-Source Heat Pump
A ground-source heat pump (sometimes called a ground-cou-
pled, geothermal, or water-source heat pump) takes advantage of
the generally more benign climate belowground as compared to that
aboveground. Under cooling mode operation, heat is discharged to
a ground loop or well that provides a lower temperature heat sink
than ambient outdoor air temperature. During winter heating opera-
tion, heat is extracted from a source that is at a higher temperature
than ambient outdoor air. Numerous green buildings have utilized
some variation of a ground-source heat pump to improve building
energy performance. First cost is higher than for a conventional air-
source heat pump, but operating costs are lower due to improved
COP values. See the “Applied Heat Pumps” and “Heat Recovery
Systems” chapters in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Systems and
Equipment for basic information on this strategy.
9.4.2 Air-to-Air Heat Exchangers
One means of improving the energy efficiency of an HVAC
system is to capture the heat or cooling effect embodied in condi-
tioned air being exhausted from a building. Often the easiest way to
utilize such a resource is to pass the heat or cooling effect to incom-
ing outdoor air (cold in the winter, hot in the summer). Both sensi-
ble and latent exchanges are possible depending upon the type of
equipment selected. See the “Air-to-Air Energy Recovery” chapter
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐251
in the ASHRAE Handbook—HVAC Systems and Equipment for
basic information on appropriate equipment and its integration.
9.4.3 Underfloor Air Distribution
Supplying conditioned air to a space via an underfloor supply
plenum has captured the imagination of a number of HVAC design-
ers working on green buildings. Several benefits are claimed for this
distribution approach. Carefully considered design, construction,
and commissioning are critical to the successful operation of an
underfloor air distribution system (Bauman and Daly 2003). Visit
the ASHRAE Web site (www.ashrae.org) for the most up-to-date
material on underfloor air distribution.
9.4.4 Green Systems and CO2
Although the design of green building HVAC systems in the
United States currently tends to focus upon the energy implications
of system selection and operation, internationally there is increas-
ing environmental concern about carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
from buildings as a key contributor to global warming. The selec-
tion of HVAC&R systems and fuels can have a major impact upon
such emissions, which are conceded by most scientists to be linked
to global warming. This concern is likely to eventually migrate to
the United States and exert a dramatic impact on HVAC&R system
design. See the ASHRAE position statement on climate change for
background information on this issue (ASHRAE 1999).

10.1 CONTEXT
Controls provide the critical link between HVAC design intent,
HVAC&R equipment and systems, and the operating building. Con-
trols are an integral part of the design of an HVAC&R system. They
implement design intent by operating the HVAC equipment as
required. Inappropriate or inoperative controls can cancel out good
design and construction and amplify occupant discontent with a
building and its systems. It is imperative that controls be designed
and implemented correctly. To provide a complete system solution,
an HVAC&R designer must consider how controls will make all
parts of the system function.
Controls are instrumental in obtaining an energy-efficient
building. Herzog and Carmody (1996) put this fairly simply: equip-
ment should operate as intended, when intended, to the extent
intended. Anything else is inefficient. There is currently growing
interest in controls as a contributor to green building status. The
growing complexity and proprietary nature of building controls,
counteracted somewhat by improvements in control capabilities
and computerization, are important issues that affect the role of
HVAC&R controls in the design and commissioning processes and
ultimate building success.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter outlines the fundamentals of controls and illus-
trates principles for providing reliable and easily maintainable con-
trol systems for a variety of air-conditioning systems. Such control
is required to match system operation with the need for space con-
ditioning. The simplest control is an ON/OFF operation typical of
residential applications where, as a thermostat senses an increase in

room temperature, the air conditioner is switched ON, and as the
temperature falls, it is switched OFF. Most large HVAC&R systems,
however, use modulating controls, i.e., controls that vary the output
of the equipment being controlled, to provide for the control of tem-
perature, humidity, and air quality in various spaces in a building.

TERMINOLOGY
Figure 10-1 provides the legend for all the figures in this chap-
ter. Figure 10-2 shows a simple cooling coil control scheme. The
basic elements of the system include a sensor, which measures a

control variable—in this case, air temperature in the duct. The con-
troller compares the sensed value with the setpoint. The difference
between the measured variable and the setpoint is called the error.
The error signal is processed to change the output from the control-
ler. In this case, the output goes to a valve that modulates the flow
of water in the coil, thereby changing the temperature of the air
leaving the coil. The process by which the controller output is influ-
enced by the sensed variable that it controls is called feedback.
Two types of feedback control strategies commonly used in
HVAC&R applications are proportional control and proportional
plus integral (PI) control. With proportional control, the controller
output varies in proportion to the error. In mathematical terms, the
controller output is
O = A + Kp e ,
(10-1)
where
A
=
a constant defining what the output should be when the error
is zero,
Kp =
proportional gain,
e
=
error, and
O
=
output.
For example, if a proportional controller was installed to control
the temperature leaving a chilled-water cooling coil and if the output
ranged from 0% to 100%, then A might be 50 and Kp might be 10.
Under these conditions, the output from the controller would be
100% when the leaving coil temperature was 5° above the setpoint,
50% when the temperature and setpoint were the same, and 0%
when the temperature was 5° below the setpoint. It would take a 10°
change in the leaving coil temperature to cause a 100% change in
the controller output. This is called the throttling range of the con-
troller. As this example suggests, the controlled variable is only
rarely at the setpoint when proportional control is used.
As the name implies, proportional plus integral (PI) control
adds integral control action. In mathematical terms,
O = A + (Kp)(e) + Ki edt ,
(8-2)
where Ki is the integral gain. By integrating the error signal over
time, the output from the controller is increasing or decreasing any
time the error is not zero. This forces the error to zero as steady state
is reached.
256⏐ HVAC&R CONTROLS
10.4 CONTROL TYPES
Three types of control hardware are used in HVAC&R sys-
tems—pneumatic, analog electronic, and direct digital control
(DDC). Historically, pneumatic controls were used in most large
building applications. They are reasonably well understood by
designers and maintenance personnel, which was a compelling rea-
son for their use. A second advantage was that pneumatic valve and
damper actuators, besides being inherently modulating, are inexpen-
sive and reliable when compared to the electric motors and gears
required to produce the same control force with electric actuation.
Most pneumatic control equipment, however, requires a very clean
source of supply air. The air must be dry and free of oil. While it
may not be difficult to install a system with clean air, one failure or
mistake, such as overfilling a compressor with oil, can permanently
foul an entire pneumatic system. Another potential disadvantage of
pneumatic controls is that they are not particularly precise. Usually,
field calibration is required in order to obtain acceptable accuracy,
and periodic recalibration of the pneumatic instruments is required.
Modern analog electronic control equipment has several
advantages. Power is provided electrically, and there are no air com-
pressors, driers, or filters to maintain. Signals flow at the speed of
light, and controllers essentially have an instantaneous response
(signal processing is instantaneous; temperature sensors and motors
still have time constants). Electronic devices can be extremely
accurate and free of drift. Resistance temperature detectors made of
platinum, nickel, or other metals manufactured to tolerances of
0.5°F [0.3°C] are relatively inexpensive, do not require field calibra-
tion, and are drift free. They are also inexpensive, and it is easy to
display electronic signals using digital readouts, providing for
ready diagnostics. Another advantage is that it is relatively easy to
implement PI control electronically. PI control has important
energy-saving advantages that will be discussed later.
In the past, electronic control systems were often more expen-
sive than pneumatic systems, partly because of the high cost of
electric valve and damper motors. Electronic control systems are
now, however, very competitive with pneumatic systems and can be
cheaper when integrated with a building automation system (BAS)
because many sensors can perform control and automation func-
tions, whereas additional sensors are required for BAS functions
with pneumatic systems. A problem with electronic control hard-
ware is that many different types of systems are in use. For exam-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐257
ple, some companies use inexpensive thermistor temperature
sensors while another uses platinum or nickel. One company may
use pulsed voltages to control actuators, while others use 0-9 or 2-10
volts. Some HVAC&R control companies use equipment that fol-
lows industrial control practice (platinum resistance temperature
sensors and 2-10 volt and 4-20 milliamp control signals). This prac-
tice makes components interchangeable and gives designers access
to a variety of high-quality industrial sensors and transducers.
ASHRAE has stepped into this area of design with the development
of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 135-2004, BACnet®—A Data Commu-
nication Protocol for Building Automation and Control Networks,
which provides a protocol for data communication services in
building automation and control systems (ASHRAE 2004).
DDC has become the standard in control systems. Large inte-
grated systems as well as small-scale control units for single-fan
systems are available for both new and retrofit applications. DDC
accepts analog electronic inputs from appropriate sensors, converts
them to digital, uses these digitized signals to produce digital out-
puts via software control algorithms resident in a local micropro-
cessor, and, finally, converts the digital output signals to analog
electronic signals to drive control actuators that may be electrical or
pneumatic. Figure 10-3 presents a schematic diagram of the DDC
system concept.
Perhaps the greatest single advantage of DDC is the flexibility
it provides because control is implemented through software rather
than hardware. Time sequencing, reset control, PI loops, economizer
cycles, and a variety of other operational schemes are accomplished
by programming a microprocessor, not by modifying or adding
hardware. Of course, with this power comes the designer’s responsi-
bility to avoid unnecessary complexity. Another benefit of DDC is
precision and a complete absence of controller drift. For example,
once a temperature setpoint is entered into a digital controller, it
Figure 10-3. DDC concept.
258⏐ HVAC&R CONTROLS
remains in the microprocessor’s memory unambiguously until it is
changed by an operator or until the controller fails. The concept of
recalibration is simply not part of digital hardware, and mainte-
nance should be required only when the hardware fails.
All problems do not vanish, however, with DDC. Analog sen-
sors may still require periodic recalibration. A serious drawback of
DDC equipment is a proliferation of programming languages and
protocols, making DDC system commissioning and maintenance
difficult, particularly since the user interface into the nuts-and-bolts
of the controls logic is often not user-friendly. Programming of con-
trols is also an issue in that it is often not transparent to the design
team and/or readily available for review by the design and commis-
sioning team. Controls programming is moving out of the design
office and into the hands of specialists, thus becoming a less inte-
gral part of the design process to the potential detriment of inte-
grated design.
10.5 CONTROL STRATEGIES
Formerly, many details of control system design were left to
the discretion of the contractor. This is no longer true, as the costs
of building operation have escalated (largely as a result of increases
in energy costs), concern for green building design has escalated
(via the impact of the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED rating
system), and control systems have become more complicated.
Today, HVAC&R designers must be intimately familiar with the
concepts and details of control systems and must be acutely aware
of how their design features affect operation and maintenance.
Building owners and operators want reliable and easily maintainable
control systems. This contradicts the move toward custom controls
programming. To meet these conflicting requirements, designers
must provide a complete conceptual design for the control system.
This includes:
•
The control sequence of operation.
•
A control logic diagram.
•
Ladder diagrams showing the interactions between the various
parts of the system.
•
A plan that allows the building and its air-conditioning systems
to be put into operation and commissioned.
•
Clear and useful operations and maintenance information.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐259
Controls for a number of HVAC&R systems are discussed in
the following sections, and examples of control sequences are given
in Appendix F. The control schematics provided usually assume that
electronic temperature sensing and control is to be used. Designers
who choose different control hardware must make the appropriate
mental adjustments to the diagrams—although the underlying logic
remains generally unchanged.
10.5.1 VAV Systems
Figure 10-4 shows a complete control system schematic for a
VAV system consisting of the following subsystems: individual
room air temperature control, supply air temperature control, mixed
air temperature control, and duct static pressure control. Room air
temperature control is achieved via VAV boxes controlled by room
thermostats. Thermostats and actuators are used to modulate the air
supply flow rate in response to room temperature. Most VAV boxes
also incorporate flow sensors to allow the box to maintain control
of flow rate under varying upstream duct pressures and provide
minimum and maximum airflow settings. VAV boxes that maintain a
set airflow regardless of inlet static pressure are referred to as pres-
sure-independent terminals. If the airflow through a VAV box does
change with changing inlet static pressure, the box is referred to as a
pressure-dependent terminal.
System-powered or self-powered (deriving motive power from
duct pressure only) VAV boxes are also available, although not com-
monly used. Some of these devices require substantial duct pressure
to operate properly. If they are being considered, it may be advis-
able to require independent performance tests before approving
them for installation.
Heating is provided where required by reheat coils at the termi-
nal boxes or by baseboard convectors. The heating is controlled
either by the room thermostat or by an outdoor air temperature sen-
sor, as described in Appendix C. Baseboard convectors or small
fan-coil units (located at floor level or above the ceiling) are a pre-
ferred approach for heating exterior zones, since their use permits
lower minimum airflow settings on the VAV boxes and allows for
building warmup and night setback heating without turning on the
air-handling system.
Supply air temperature control should be accomplished using a
temperature sensor, a PI controller, appropriate transducers, and a
two-way throttling or three-way mixing valve on the cooling coil
(as shown in Figure 10-4). Commissioning plans should include
260⏐ HVAC&R CONTROLS
Figure 10-4. Control schematic for a VAV system.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐261
detailed descriptions of how to test the control system for stable
operation under low and high airflow conditions and cooling loads.
Temperature sensors should be located far enough downstream from
the fan discharge to ensure adequate mixing (but not farther than
25 ft [7.6 m]), and their locations should be shown on the control
drawings. Outdoor and return air dampers should be controlled to
achieve the appropriate temperature. This is done by a temperature
sensor connected to a PI controller that modulates the dampers. The
setpoint of the mixed air temperature controller should be lower
than the setpoint of the supply air temperature controller by the
value of the temperature rise across the fan. Two temperature sen-
sors in the outdoor and return airstreams can be used in conjunction
with a comparator that evaluates the temperature signals and returns
the outdoor and relief air dampers to their minimum positions
whenever the outdoor air is warmer (or has a higher enthalpy) than
the return air.
Construction details showing the connection of outdoor and
return air ducts to the air-handling equipment should be included in
the drawings. Baffles or other devices should be used to minimize
stratification in this part of the duct system. Complete mixing of the
outdoor and return air is necessary if the mixed-air temperature sen-
sor is to sense a meaningful value.
Modulation of fan speed (or an alternative technique) is usually
employed in VAV systems to achieve energy efficiency, avoid
potentially damaging duct pressures, and permit the VAV boxes to
perform adequately. Consider PI control for this application. Vary-
ing the fan speed is the preferred control method. Not only is it the
most efficient, but it can also modulate to lower airflow rates and it
avoids the problems of stuck or broken vanes or linkages. The com-
missioning plan should include a requirement to test the stability of
the control system with all the VAV boxes at their minimum airflow
setting. If fans can produce potentially damaging duct pressures, a
high-pressure limit switch or blowout panel should be provided.
Mutammara and Hittle (1990) compared the energy consump-
tion in high-rise office buildings in five different climates under a
variety of control strategies. They found that, except in hot, humid
climates, the most energy-efficient control strategies are (1) PI con-
trol with an economizer and (2) cold deck reset for perimeter zones.
Cold deck reset involves the use of room thermostat signals to reset
the discharge air temperature (discriminating control, see Section
9.3.3). While this system can provide additional energy efficiency,
reliability is a serious question. Failure of an individual room ther-
262⏐ HVAC&R CONTROLS
mostat or tampering by an occupant could cause the air temperatures
to be adjusted to an unreasonably low value. Fan energy also
increases, which might lead to an increase in operating cost. Thus,
the simpler fixed deck temperature with PI control and an econo-
mizer may be more attractive. Economizers are not recommended
for hot, humid climates because the number of hours during which
they can be used effectively is small. Instead, minimum outdoor air
is provided for quality ventilation.
Return fans should generally be avoided in VAV systems
because good control of return fans is difficult and involves sophis-
ticated hardware. Return fans also require more energy than relief
fans, as shown in Section 6.8.2.4. If, however, a return fan is abso-
lutely essential for a particular application, it must be controlled.
Appropriate return fan control minimizes pressure fluctuations and
increases energy efficiency. The simplest method is to use the output
from the supply duct static pressure controller to also modulate the
return fan. Figure 10-5 shows this scheme. The success of this type
of control is dependent upon the supply and return fans having sim-
ilar performance characteristics throughout the flow range. It is
most effective if the fans are properly set up at full flow to provide
the right difference between supply and return airflow and if both
fans have similar part-load performance characteristics. A more
complicated, but more effective, scheme is to let the supply fan
speed adjust to maintain the minimum duct static pressure, measure
Figure 10-5. Simple return fan control.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐263
the supply airflow rate with a flow-measuring device, and use that
flow as an input to the return fan controller, as shown in Figure 10-
6. The speed of the return fan would be adjusted to provide the
desired air volume difference between the supply and return fans.
This control requires careful setup. Both supply fan and return fan
flow measurements must be normalized to their respective full-flow
conditions. Even in the best circumstances, flow measurements
may then be only roughly correct.
Conventional flow-measuring stations are often used to control
return fans. Pitot tube racks provide a pressure signal that is trans-
formed to an electronic (or pneumatic) control signal by a pressure
transducer. Unfortunately, at low flow rates, the velocity pressure is so
low that it is almost impossible to sense this pressure, especially with
low-cost transducers. One solution is to build a special duct section
with a reduced cross-sectional area. The flow stations can be placed
in these reduced cross sections where velocity is higher. One manufac-
turer recommends a minimum velocity of 700 fpm [3.6 m/s]. Reduced
cross sections should be sized to maintain this minimum velocity.
Alternatively, if space permits, a venturi can be built into a straight
section of both the supply and return ducts with the difference in
upstream and throat static pressure converted to flow velocity. Another
method, which provides a good velocity pressure signal even at low
airflows, is to install the airflow-measuring device in the fan volute,
Figure 10-6. Flow-matching control of return fans.
264⏐ HVAC&R CONTROLS
where the velocities are higher than in the ductwork. A very accurate
pressure transducer is required with whatever scheme is selected.
Another flow-measuring technique uses hot-wire anemome-
ters. If this approach is employed, appropriate air guides must be
provided so that the anemometers measure only translational flow
along the duct and not rotational or turbulent flow caused by local
disturbances. The arrangement of properly connected hot-wire ane-
mometers intended to provide average duct velocities must be spec-
ified in detail.
For most comfort applications, individual rooms can be con-
trolled with proportional thermostats with local (in-the-room) setpoint
adjustment. It is becoming common practice, however, to not provide
for local thermostat adjustment in commercial/institutional buildings
in an attempt to maximize energy efficiency and minimize mainte-
nance. An alternative is to install temperature sensors with a slider
bar that permits local adjustment. The slider bar can be programmed
to establish how much temperature adjustment is allowed. The tem-
perature control profile for the VAV dampers and heating coil (or
baseboard heaters) should be as shown in Figures 10-7 and 10-8.
Room thermostats should not be located on exterior walls, in
dead corners, or in other unsuitable locations where they are likely
to be unduly affected by equipment, occupant, or solar radiation
loads. The best locations are those that provide some air motion and
allow thermostats to sense the average room temperature. The loca-
tion of all thermostats should be indicated on the plans. If add-on,
tamperproof covers are used, they should be constructed to allow
free air movement over the thermostat. Metal or plastic box-type
security enclosures with minimal air slits should not be used, since
they do not provide enough airflow over the thermostat for it to
respond rapidly to changing room conditions. If thermostats must be
installed on exterior walls, insulating bases should be used and the
wall penetration sealed airtight.
10.5.2 Single-Zone, Constant-Volume Air Systems
Very small single-zone air-handling units are thermodynami-
cally equivalent to room fan-coil units or residential air-condition-
ing systems and can be controlled by simple two-position electric or
electronic thermostat/valve systems common in this type of unit.
For larger single-zone systems, one of the schemes illustrated
in Figures 10-9 and 10-11 can be used. Figure 10-9 shows a mini-
mum configuration, which may provide inadequate control and
should be used only on closely coupled systems, i.e., systems with
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐265
relatively short ductwork and high air volume flow rates compared
to the room volume. In this scheme, a room or return air tempera-
ture sensor is connected to a single proportional controller, which
modulates the heating coil valve, mixing dampers, and cooling coil
valve in sequence.
The temperature control profiles should be as shown in
Figure 10-10. The outdoor and return air temperature sensors are
used to return the outdoor and return air dampers to the minimum
position whenever the outdoor air is warmer (or of higher enthalpy,
if enthalpy control is used) than the return air. This economizer cycle
should have a hysteresis of up to 2°F [1°C], i.e., the cycle should be
initiated or terminated when the outdoor air is 2°F [1°C] cooler or
warmer than the return air. The proper sequencing of the valves and
dampers is achieved by carefully adjusting the positioners on the
equipment. Verification of successful sequencing should be part of
Figure 10-7. Room temperature control profile for “zero energy band”
thermostat (temperatures shown are merely suggested values).

mostat (temperatures shown are merely suggested values).

the commissioning plan and ongoing operations and maintenance
checks. The room temperature sensors should not be located in the
return air duct if the return air is drawn through lighting fixtures or
in any other case where the return air would be at a different temper-
ature than the room air. Under such circumstances, a wall-mounted
room thermostat should be used.
The scheme shown in Figure 10-11 should be used in applica-
tions that have longer ductwork and require tighter control or that
serve very large rooms. This scheme uses a room or return-air tem-
perature sensor connected to a proportional controller to reset three
PI controllers. One controller modulates the cooling coil valve, one
the heating coil valve, and one the mixing dampers. The reset
scheme of Figure 10-12 should be used for this system. The mixed-
air and supply-air temperature sensors should be mounted as in the
VAV system.
If very tight temperature and humidity control is required, one
of the systems shown in Figures 10-13 and 10-14 should be used.
The system shown in Figure 10-13 is more efficient and can be used
where loads are fairly constant and mostly sensible (where reheating
is not required for humidity control). Room temperature control is
achieved through a PI controller that modulates the heating coil,
cooling coil, and outdoor and return air dampers in sequence. Air
temperature sensors return the outdoor air dampers to their mini-
mum position when the outdoor air is hotter (or of higher enthalpy)

zone control system shown in Figure 10-9.

than the return air. Note that the cascade control system recom-
mended for single-zone systems is not used here because the system
is expected to run continuously and load variations are expected to
be small and to occur slowly. Hence the temperature control system
can be set up to be fairly sluggish. In heavily loaded interior spaces,
no heating coil is needed because there is always a requirement for
cooling and plenty of heat is generated in the space—except in situa-
tions where a dehumidification cycle is required.
The humidifier is controlled with a proportional controller
whose sensor is downstream of the humidifier. This controller is
reset by the output of the PI controller whose sensor is in the return
airstream or in the room. This avoids adding excess moisture to the
supply airstream, which could cause dripping in the discharge duct.
Figure 10-14 shows a more extensive humidity control system.
While it is more energy intensive, it ensures sufficient dehumidifi-
cation under more widely varying loads or in cases where latent
heat gains are higher. A constant supply air temperature is main-
tained by modulating the cooling coil as well as the outdoor and
return air dampers in exactly the same way and using the same com-
ponents as in the VAV system described in Section 10.5.1. A PI con-
troller sensing return or room air temperature modulates the reheat

coil valve to control the room temperature. The humidifier is con-
trolled as shown in Figure 10-13.
10.5.3 Dual-Duct Systems
A potential automatic control arrangement for a dual-duct sys-
tem is shown in Figure 10-15. It is adequate for most installations
and can be easily modified to suit particular applications and
requirements. The minimum outdoor air damper is open when the
fan is running, except when all areas are unoccupied during warm-
up. The hot duct temperature is controlled by the submaster hot duct
thermostat, which operates the heating coil valve (or valves) in
sequence. The control point of this thermostat is reset by the outdoor
master thermostat according to a predetermined schedule.
The air in the cold duct is maintained at the desired dew-point
temperature by the cold duct thermostat, which operates a cooling
coil valve. At a predetermined outdoor air temperature, the system
is switched to economizer cooling by a two-position switchover
thermostat. When outdoor air is used for cooling, the cold duct ther-
mostat controls the operation of the maximum outdoor air, exhaust,
and return air dampers through the use of a three-way air valve. This
thermostat also controls the operation of the cooling coil when
mechanical cooling is required.
The control of the central system is simple, since it is asked
only to serve as a source of warm and cold dehumidified air. There
are numerous possible refinements for operating economies, venti-
lation optimization, and so forth.
Dual-duct systems with mechanical or automatic flow regula-
tors do not need fan or system static pressure regulation, since each
terminal unit compensates for any changes in backpressure. To take
full advantage of fan energy savings at reduced flow conditions in
dual-duct VAV systems, however, fan regulation is recommended.
This also helps to avoid high-pressure-drop noise effects in VAV
terminal units and is a more important consideration in dual-fan
systems.
10.6 COMPONENTS
Control valves must be sized to provide proper control stability
and authority. Authority is the ratio of the pressure drop through the
wide-open valve to the combined pressure drop through the valve
and coil or valve and heat exchanger. Line-size valves are almost
always too large. Valve sizes and valve coefficients should be
shown on a schedule on the plans. Equal percentage valves (see
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐273
Figure 10-15. Simple automatic control for dual-duct system.
274⏐ HVAC&R CONTROLS
Section 5.6.2) with a turndown ratio of 20:1 or better are usually
needed for most HVAC applications. The authority of control
valves should usually be 0.3 or higher. Additional information on
valves is presented in Section 5.6.
Dampers are often provided with air-conditioning systems and
are frequently too large. For control purposes, opposed-blade damp-
ers or a mixture of opposed- and parallel-blade dampers usually pro-
vide the best performance. In most cases, dampers should be smaller
than the return or outdoor air duct. The wide-open velocity through
a damper that is to control airflow should preferably be 1500 fpm
[7.6 m/s] or higher. Dampers should be shown on a schedule on the
plans. Experience has shown that copper, nylon, or thermoplastic
bushings on damper shafts may fail prematurely. Since dampers do
not receive routine maintenance in most HVAC systems, the use of
sealed ball bearings at the ends of shafts is recommended.
Positive positioners should be specified for most pneumatic
valves and actuators, except for the small actuators on VAV boxes,
reheat coils, or baseboard heaters. A pilot positioner is required to
reduce hysteresis, to improve actuator response, and to permit
adjusting of the gain of the controlled device.

This appendix provides an outline of building, system, and load
characteristics for a multi-use building that will provide a basis for
discussion and comparison in the following appendices.
As noted in Chapter 1, these appendices present examples of
real projects. These projects were selected for the first edition of
this manual and have been retained for the second edition. Some
design values may, as a result, appear dated. This is, however, not
too critical in the context of a process example. The specific charac-
teristics of any particular project will vary from those suggested
herein—as influenced by client requirements, project budget, appli-
cable codes and standards, and design team intent. The purpose of
these appendices is not to show expected results or recommended

A.1 BUILDING AND SYSTEM BASICS
1.
A single fan room will be installed on each office floor; the fan
room will house a complete factory-packaged combination
air-handling unit and self-contained DX cooling system (coil
and refrigeration compressor), as follows:
a.
The air-handling system will consist of two 11,000 cfm
[5190 L/s] supply air fans with inlet vortex dampers,
APPENDIX A
PROPOSED MECHANICAL AND
ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS FOR AN OFFICE
BUILDING WITH RETAIL STORES
276⏐ APPENDIX A
pleated (flat) filters, cleanable precooling coils, DX-type
cooling coils, and controls.
b.
Each DX unit will be rated at 35 tons [123 kW] and will
consist of two separate compressors arranged for sequen-
tial start and simultaneous use when the load requires.
c.
The DX units on each floor will be connected to a
2500 ton [8790 kW] capacity multi-cell cooling tower
located on the roof and with pumps located in the base-
ment. An auxiliary pair of condenser water risers will be
installed for use by future tenants.
d.
The condenser water pumps and the auxiliary risers will be
piped such that it will be possible to isolate one of the
tower cells with the auxiliary risers for winter operation.
2.
The air distribution system on each floor will consist of a VAV
fan, medium-pressure ductwork upstream of the terminal
boxes, conventional VAV boxes serving the interior zone from
a common interior/perimeter air distribution main, and
fan-powered VAV boxes serving the perimeter zones. Heating
will be provided by means of electric resistance coils placed in
the low-pressure supply air ductwork downstream of the indi-
vidual terminal boxes.
3.
Ventilation air for the individual fan rooms will be provided via
a vertical, fan-pressurized air shaft. The fan will contain a heat-
ing section for preheating the outdoor air to 40°F [4.4°C] to
prevent freeze-ups at the individual floor units. The shaft will
be sized to provide up to 15% (3300 cfm [1557 L/s]) outdoor
air to each floor’s air-handling system.
4.
Two vertica1 exhaust shafts will be connected to exhaust fans
on the roof, capable of exhausting approximately 8 to 10 ach
from the largest floor in the building.
5.
Stair pressurization fans will be capable of pressurizing the
individual stair shafts with outdoor air during alarm conditions.
6.
A complete fire standpipe system serving sprinkler loops on
each floor will be connected to two fire pumps piped in a cas-
cading arrangement.
7.
Local electric domestic hot water heaters will serve the tenant-
floor toilet rooms three or more floors at a time. Toilet rooms
will have floor drains as required by code.
8.
Electric service at 480/277 volts will be obtained from a public
utility transformer vault, constructed under the sidewalk or
roadway adjoining the building, with service distributed
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐277
throughout the building via bus ducts run vertically through
electric closets on each floor.
9.
An emergency electrical distribution system and an emergency
generator will be installed to provide power for life-safety and
other critical equipment in the event of a failure of the normal
power supply.
A.2 DESIGN CRITERIA

Ventilation Criteria
Office spaces. In response to concerns about acceptable indoor air
quality in office buildings (to avoid sick building syndrome), it was
decided by the client and design team that a minimum of 15 cfm [7 L/s]
per person of outdoor air will be supplied. Provision will be made at
each air-handling unit control panel to remotely vary the quantity of
outdoor air intake into each unit via control of the outdoor air damper
position. Toilet rooms and janitor’s closets will be exhausted at the rate
of 75 cfm [35 L/s] per fixture. Note that on any project an owner’s
directives regarding ventilation would be coordinated with current
requirements of local codes and national standards.
Electrical spaces. In general, a minimum of 8 ach will be mechani-
cally exhausted. Positive supply will be utilized for all areas con-
taining transformers or other heat-dissipating equipment requiring
larger amounts of exhaust.
Main telephone room and elevator machine rooms. Conditions
will be provided in accordance with the requirements of these
equipment providers; it is anticipated that these spaces will be con-
ditioned similarly to comfort-based spaces.
4.
Acoustical Criteria
The following design criteria for background noise will be
used for the occupied spaces:
Offices
NC-35 (except where adjacent to a fan room)
Corridors
NC-40
Conference rooms NC-35
Lobby
NC-45
5.
Air Filtration
Outdoor air and recirculated air will be filtered at the air-han-
dling units by means of filters meeting the requirements of
Standard 62.1.
6.
Domestic Hot Water
The domestic hot water system will be designed in accordance
with the “Service Water Heating” chapter in the ASHRAE Hand-
book—HVAC Applications. Electric storage-type heaters providing
140°F [60°C] water to building plumbing fixtures will be provided
every three floors (with due consideration to anti-scalding controls).

† 25,000/60 = 417 ft2/ton [2324/211 = 11.0 m2/kW]
280⏐ APPENDIX A
The typical office floor will demand 65 tons [229 kW] of cool-
ing if the maximum building demand is shared equally among the
25 typical floors. Due to the expected load variation between floors,
it is recommended that each floor be provided with a minimum of
70 tons [246 kW] of cooling capacity under a floor-by-floor
air-conditioning system concept. Therefore, the minimum projected
installed capacity would be 25 × 70 + 300 tons for lobby, etc. [25 ×
246 + 1055 kW] = 2050 tons [7210 kW], and the proposed cooling
tower capacity is 2500 tons [8790 kW].
Note: The calculations for the heating load and installed capacity
are not shown here. The supply air quantity for each typical office
floor, however, has been calculated as follows:
Base building, with 0.5/0.5 glass
=

A.4 ENERGY SOURCE AND UTILITY ANALYSIS
The available energy sources at the site and their estimated
average price per unit of consumption at the time of project design
were set as follows:
Electric power, normal use
9.0¢/kWh
Electric power, heating
7.6¢/kWh
Natural gas, firm
47¢/therm [0.45¢/MJ]
Natural gas, interruptible
32¢/therm [0.30¢/MJ]
No. 2 fuel oil
60¢/gal [15.6¢/L]
Electric power prices are for delivered energy at the job site,
with perhaps 3% to 5% inefficiency or line losses prior to con-
sumption. The fossil fuel prices, on the other hand, are for raw
fuel, which, by means of a boiler plant, has to be converted into
heat energy.
When depreciated over a 20-year period (at a 10% interest
rate) and adjusted for owning costs and additional labor cost—
under the conditions assumed for this analysis—the heating
energy generated in a fossil fuel plant is more costly than pur-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐281
chased electric energy, especially where there is a reduced
demand charge for electrically heated buildings. This particular
conclusion is project- and site-specific.
The following is a comparison of overall energy production
costs, per million Btu [per 1,055,000 kJ], delivered to the system,
between the electric and the fossil fuel-heated building.

Note: Plant labor is based upon an additional crew of 1.5, requiring
$60,000 per year more than the all-electric system. Owning or plant
amortization cost is based upon one million dollars in extra con-
struction cost attributable to the boiler plant plus the penalty to be
paid for the “wet” system with hot-water heating boilers. Therefore,
conclusions on the various available energy sources are as follows:
1.
Electric energy is more expensive in terms of its unit price and
annual heating energy cost, but it will prove to be more eco-
nomical when used in connection with a “dry” resistance heat-
ing system. This is because a fossil-fueled plant, using No. 2
heating oil or natural gas and distributing steam or hot water
through a “wet” piping system, will raise the overall construc-
tion cost of the building by $1.0 to $1.2 million.
2.
In the case of a refrigeration plant for this project, the recom-
mended source of energy is electric power. Other types of
drives cannot generally compete with electric motor-driven
chillers. Over the past several decades, input to electric-drive
chillers has been reduced from roughly 0.85 to 0.90 kW/ton
[0.24 to 0.26 kW/kW] to around 0.65 to 0.70 kW/ton [0.18 to
0.20 kW/kW] at the time of this project analysis, to around
0.55 to 0.65 kW/ton [0.16 to 0.19 kW/kW] currently—a sub-
stantial series of reductions, while input requirements to
steam-driven chillers have remained essentially the same.
3.
Although the utility or fuel cost for the gas-fired heating sys-
tem is lower than that of the electrically heated building, the
first cost of the gas-fired boiler cannot be economically justi-
fied during the lifetime of this building project.
282⏐ APPENDIX A
A.5 CENTRAL VERSUS
DECENTRALIZED HVAC OPTIONS
Two possible options for locating the air-handling systems
have been evaluated:
Option 1. A central fan room located at the lowest floor (above the
entry lobby) and another one at the building penthouse, thus serving
the entire building from two locations. This option involves very
large air-handling units and extensive ductwork distribution.
Option 2. One fan room per floor. This option reduces equipment
size and ductwork distribution demands but places major equip-
ment on each floor.
The choice between central and local-floor fan room schemes
depends upon the following:
1.
Structural design, such as column transfer levels and similar
issues, encouraging the use of a central fan room.
2.
Major tenants’ staffing and the preferred mode of servicing and
maintaining the mechanical and electrical systems.
3.
Method of tenant utility metering and billing.
4.
Anticipated overtime or off-hour use of the building systems
on different floors.
5.
First cost, operating cost, and rental space considerations.
6.
Building height restrictions, if any.

AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐283
In this project, the proposed structural system does not require
column transfer space; therefore, there is no unused secondary
space suitable for mechanical equipment installation. There is no
known tenant preference for either option, and there are no height
restrictions. Frequent overtime and off-hour use of the building
HVAC systems is anticipated. There appears to be no problem in
proportionately billing tenants for overtime use of the system with-
out installing individual electrical meters on each floor.
The overall installed costs of the central fan room option and
the fan-room-per-floor option are approximately the same. From an
operating cost standpoint, there are two issues to be considered:
1.
The use of an air-side economizer in conjunction with the cen-
tral fan room option favors this concept by approximately
$23,000 per year in terms of energy cost, as shown in the sum-
mary (A.6). This is because a water-side economizer (associ-
ated with the floor-by-floor fan room scheme) is less efficient
at or near outdoor temperatures when the changeover from the
cooling to the heating mode takes place. An air-side econo-
mizer can provide “free cooling” at temperatures below 55°F
[12.8°C] outdoors, whereas with the water-side economizer,
free cooling will not be available until the outdoor air tempera-
ture reaches 50°F–45°F [10.0°C–7.2°C].
2.
The requirement for off-hour operation of the system favors the
fan room per floor approach since complete shutdown of
unneeded systems is possible with this scheme whenever a
floor is not in use. With a central fan room scheme, although
energy savings via system turndown will be available, the
resulting energy savings are not anticipated to be as great as
available from complete shutdown of many units that would be
likely with a floor-by-floor system arrangement.

284⏐ APPENDIX A
The operating costs of the central chilled-water plant will be
lower during normal working hours since the larger machines are
more efficient and can also take advantage of the considerable
diversity of loads in a large building. It is during the extended peri-
ods of use beyond normal working hours that the individual air-con-
ditioning units on each floor will be much more economical to
operate than a lightly loaded central chiller.
3.
Maintenance Costs
The maintenance costs of a central chilled-water plant (with
multiple chillers) were anticipated to be less than the costs of main-
taining a multiplicity of individual refrigeration packages. It was
also believed likely that replacement costs for individual units
would be higher than for the central plant. The likelihood of main-
tenance problems is much higher for the individual refrigeration
units, since regular maintenance can be carried out during the
off-season on the central chillers, even during water-side econo-
mizer operation, while preventive maintenance is generally not
undertaken on installations with numerous individual units.
4.
Leasing Considerations
From a tenant’s standpoint, the concept of total control of one’s
office environment, day and night, is favorably looked upon by peo-
ple responsible for leasing space. There does not seem to be a draw-
back in apportioning the additional cost of overtime system use to
the tenants actually using the equipment, whether they are full-floor
or part-floor tenants.
5.
Space Requirements
Investigation confirms that the area allotted to the fan room per
floor approach need not be enlarged to accommodate the addition
of a DX chiller section, whereas the central chiller plant approach
will require 4000 ft2 [372 m2] of space in the basement.
6.
F1exibility, Reliability, and Redundancy
The central chiller plant approach, almost by definition, is
more flexible and more reliable and possesses a greater degree of
redundancy than the approach involving individual cooling pack-
ages in each fan room. On the other hand, if one of the main chillers
broke down during a peak-load day, the entire building would be
affected, whereas with the individual units, only the respective floor
would be involved.
7.
Energy Considerations
The project will be in compliance with energy codes applica-
ble at the time of design. Energy-efficiency enhancements, such as
heat recovery, economizer cycle, and thermal storage, are feasible
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐285
with the central plant concept. These alternatives have been stud-
ied, however, and have not proved to be economically viable. The
greatest energy savings will be attained as a result of the decision
to use high-performance glass with a low (0.30 [1.70]) U-factor
and a low (0.30) shading coefficient (approximately equal to solar
heat gain coefficient).
8.
Recommendation
Based on the foregoing, it was recommended that individual
packaged DX units be incorporated within each of the individual
floor air-handling systems in lieu of a central chilled-water plant.
This recommendation was made with the understanding that poten-
tial noise and vibration problems inherent in these units will be
addressed by an acoustical consultant and that the unit specified and
installed will have been successfully used in prior installations.
A.7 PERIMETER HVAC SYSTEM OPTIONS
Details of the heating energy calculations are not reproduced
here. Three perimeter heating schemes were investigated:
•
VAV + perimeter baseboard heat
•
VAV + perimeter fan-powered VAV (FPVAV)
•
VAV + perimeter four-pipe fan-coil units
The following two tables summarize the results of a com-
puter analysis on the percentage and type of glass in the facade
and the overall effectiveness of the three types of perimeter sys-
tems studied.

286⏐ APPENDIX A
The following conclusions were drawn from this analysis:
1.
The utility costs for the baseboard heating scheme are depicted
as being the highest because of the assumption of uncontrolled
heat delivery in winter. Other control schemes, such as zoning
the baseboard radiation by exposure, would be expected to
change this conclusion.
2.
The utility costs of the four-pipe fan-coil system are the low-
est because more than 50% of the floor’s cooling is being
accomplished through chilled water piped to the fan-coil
units. Compared to an all-air VAV system, the fan-coil system
uses much less fan energy to achieve the same amount of
perimeter cooling.
3.
Despite the operating cost advantages of the fan-coil system,
the perimeter fan-powered variable-air-volume system dis-
plays the lowest overall cost. This is due to its low first cost
and its reasonably good energy performance compared to the
fan-coil system.
The major reasons for thus recommending the fan-powered
VAV system are:
1.
Its first cost is more accurately predictable because of its
common usage for this type of application. It is definitely
less expensive to install than a comparable four-pipe
fan-coil system.
2.
Its annual energy cost is 14% less than that of the fan-coil sys-
tem and 37% less than that of the baseboard heating system.

light” available from the ceiling plenum for winter heating is
the main reason for its superior performance.
3.
The fan-powered VAV system would permit the use of
floor-to-ceiling glass (with 8 to 12 in. [200 to 300 mm] sill
height) contemplated for this building, whereas standard
fan-coil units require higher sills (lower profile units are not
available at competitive prices). Note that this essentially archi-
tectural decision (valuing floor-to-ceiling glass) will likely
have winter comfort implications for occupants (without
under-glass radiation) unless high-performance glazing is used.
4.
The heating elements provided with the fan-powered VAV
boxes can provide warm-up (in winter) without running the
air-handling system fans. Similarly, they can provide tempo-
rary heat prior to occupancy if installed without ductwork in
their permanent locations.
A.8 PROPOSED AIR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
FOR TYPICAL FLOOR
Under a fan-powered VAV system, a 5 ft [1.5 m] deep perim-
eter “isolation” zone will receive conditioned air from overhead
ductwork. One fan-powered variable-air-volume control box in
the suspended ceiling space will be assigned to each 450 ft2
[42 m2] of floor area and will be controlled by a zone thermostat.
Boxes will have electric resistance heating coils located down-
stream in the low-pressure ductwork. The perimeter zones will be
supplied with air through a continuous slot between columns via
4 ft [1.2 m] boots.
The interior zones of the floor will have conventional boxes,
one per 1000 ft2 [93 m2] of floor area, connected to a common
main supply air duct serving the entire floor. VAV boxes will be
controlled by zone thermostats. Supply air may be delivered
through conventional 2 by 2 ft [0.6 by 0.6 m] air diffusers suitable
for installation in a 2 by 4 ft [0.6 by 1.2 m] lay-in ceiling or
through 12 by 12 in. [300 by 300 mm] modular diffusers. Space air
will be returned primarily through air slots incorporated within the
lighting fixtures. A certain number of interior VAV boxes will have
duct heaters as required by the floor slab or roof exposure of the
space served or as required by special zoning or warm-up needs of
the space. Controls will be electronic with local DDC panels capa-
ble of handling desired local functions as well as forming part of a
central building control system.
288⏐ APPENDIX A
A.9 BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM
A central and expandable building automation system (BAS) is
recommended. The system will be composed of a programmable
central monitoring, control, and supervisory system that incorpo-
rates and integrates the following functions from the various local
DDC field panels:
1.
Automatic temperature control system readouts and status of
equipment.
2.
Energy management functions, such as logging of equipment
run-time and scheduled start/stop.
3.
Central monitoring of VAV box air volumes, temperature set-
points, and zone temperatures.
4.
Trend logging of zone temperatures and other key system
parameters.
5.
System operation and maintenance scheduling.
6.
Control of lighting systems.

B.1 INTRODUCTION
The sample calculations in this appendix and in Appendix C
illustrate the application of the procedures presented in Chapter 6,
“All-Air HVAC Systems.” Any conclusions drawn from this system
analysis apply only to the specific application presented; they do
not necessarily apply universally. Specific values for various design
variables on a particular project would need to comply with local
codes and match the design intent of the owner and design team. A
step-by-step procedure is given for the load components of each air
system accompanied by a corresponding psychrometric chart plot.
Several off-season operating conditions are also analyzed to illus-
trate the ability of each system to maintain design conditions under
a wide range of loads.
The building analyzed here and in Appendix C is a multi-
exposure, multistory building. Treatment of the roof as to loads or
control zones is ignored, and all vertical separations are assumed
to be ceiling-to-floor assemblies without a roof. All decks are con-
sidered floors separating conditioned spaces; therefore, deck losses
are a heat loss from, not a heat gain to, the ceiling plenum.
Supply and return ducts are assumed to be placed outside the
conditioned spaces, so that they do not affect ceiling temperatures.
This assumption is made for simplicity but, if the supply ducts in
the return air plenum are insulated and there are only small runs of
return air stub-ducting in the ceiling, the resulting error is small. It
is also assumed that the peak airflow for all rooms is governed by
room sensible heat loads.
All fan heat gains are assumed to occur as a temperature rise at
the fan discharge even though the velocity pressure component of
fan energy occurs along the length of the ductwork. This introduces
APPENDIX B

a small psychrometric error when draw-through and blow-through
systems are compared. The velocity at the fan discharge is assumed
to be 2500 fpm [12.7 m/s] or 0.39 in. of water [97 Pa] velocity pres-
sure (VP). In a system with 6 in. of water [1.5 kPa] total pressure
(TP), this VP represents only 6.5% of the total pressure (or energy)
of the fan. Such an error is accepted for simplicity in this analysis.
As noted in Chapter 1, this appendix presents an example from
a real project. This project was selected for the first edition of this
manual and has been retained for the second edition. Some design
values may, as a result, appear dated. This is, however, not too
critical in the context of a process example. The purpose of this
appendix is not to show expected results or recommended inputs
for any given project but rather to outline design procedures and
considerations. Economic analyses and conclusions are particu-
larly vulnerable to local conditions and assumptions. The conclu-
sions presented here regarding economic decisions should not be
viewed as establishing general patterns or directions for design
decision making.
The analyses in this appendix were conducted in I-P units. SI
units have also been provided, but I-P and SI numerical values may
not correspond exactly due to rounding and approximations during
conversions.

Assume no roof (for simplicity, see Section B-1); therefore,
loads are from walls and glass only, distributed over the 16 ft
[4.9 m] perimeter area that is partitioned from the interior area. The
following figures are in Btu/h ft2 [W/m2] of perimeter floor area.
Each exposure (of 10 stories) has 17,675 ft2 [1643 m2] of floor
area. Total loads for the perimeter area are, therefore:

mission from ceiling and floor cavities to room area. These

analyzed in this appendix.
B.2.5 Lighting and Miscellaneous Electric Loads
The following tabulation includes ballasts, office equipment,
and other plug loads shown as design values with and without a
10% diversity allowance. Only systems with true VAV characteris-
tics in multiple zone applications are allowed diversity reductions,
since constant-volume systems must provide capacities for max
(the sum of the individual peaks). When the ceiling is a return air
plenum, only part of the lighting heat gain to the ceiling is retrans-
mitted to the room as a space heat gain. With a stagnant ceiling in a
ducted return air system, however, all of it is retransmitted.

B.2.9 Special Room Loads
Table B-1 lists standard load components for typical rooms
under various operating conditions. The first set of calculations in
this appendix will help in understanding the numbers in the table.
B.2.10 System Calculations
For simplicity, all overall system calculations are based upon
either the block loads or Σmax loads, assuming that summer sensi-
ble heat conditions govern all room air volumes. In unusual cases,
certain room air volumes and room peak calculations may indicate
that ventilation, humidity, or winter sensible heat concerns may
govern, but these conditions rarely occur and are ignored in the
present analysis. In all cases, particular stress is given to system cal-
culations as they affect room conditions, particularly humidity.
B.3 LOAD CALCULATION FOR
CONSTANT-VOLUME SINGLE-ZONE SYSTEM
Although the nature and the magnitude of the stated design
criteria were chosen to permit analysis and comparison of the
results for fairly sizable buildings with a requirement for zoning
flexibility, they are used here as the loads for a simple, sin-
gle-zone system to illustrate basic procedures. Even though the
type of system analyzed here is not recommended as a design
solution for this application, the results serve to illustrate that the
use of more sophisticated air systems might result in appreciable
increases in air, refrigeration, and heating capacities to achieve
the desired effects. Figure B-1 represents the system cycle and
shows the state of air at all locations noted in Figure 6-l(A). The
corresponding points on the psychrometric chart and the compo-
nent heat quantities absorbed or liberated between points are illus-
trated in Figures 6-1(B) and 6-1(C). Assume that the simple,
single-zone load is identical to the simultaneous peak load of the
entire building, as if there were just one large area with diversity.
B.3.1 Cooling Cycle Calculations at System Peak
Step 1. Find trial room sensible heat gain; it cannot be finalized
until heat gains from the ceiling and floor cavities are determined
after finding the average plenum temperature. Assume that 40% of
heat from ceiling-mounted lighting will be transmitted to the room,
both down through the ceiling and up through the floor below (see
Figure B-1).

Step 2. Find the supply air temperature and the trial supply and
return airflow. With a draw-through coil and the fan and drive com-
pletely enclosed in the fan plenum, all the heat of the supply fan,
motor, and drive, as well as the supply duct transmission loss,
becomes a temperature rise in the supply air after the cooling coil.
Notes for Table B-1 (a and b). Only the basic criteria that apply to any system design are given
in this table. Blanks are left where data will vary from one system to another. No diversity in
individual rooms is allowed at peak.
1.
Electrical loads in specific areas vary from the average of 5.23 W/ft2 [56.3 W/m2],
depending upon plug loads and/or nonstandard ceiling lighting. Loads are intended to be
actual demands, not connected loads.
2.
Loads are pure wall and glass conduction with no allowance or prorating for roof.
3.
These are solar loads over and above conduction loads. Items (2) and (3) for each area
correspond to the Btu/ft2 [kW/m2] maximum loads from Section B-2.3, Summer Design
Transmission Loads. Only Room 3, south, is given at its noon peak; all other rooms peak
individually but simultaneously in late afternoon.
4.
Direct heat emissions from lighting to any room are considered to be the same for all sys-
tems, but indirect transmission through floor and ceiling from the return air plenum are a
function of the average ceiling temperature, which varies with the return air volume from
the room and the temperature above the deck or below the floor adjacent to uncondi-
tioned spaces.
5.
The percent of full load lighting is indicated for each room. Systems lighting for all 65/
65°F [18.3/18.3°C] outdoor conditions is 75%. For interior spaces, 65% of full load light-
ing is assumed a realistic minimum in a preplanned, modular lighting system for an area
without business machines and task lamps, since local occupancy switches are rarely pro-
vided. For a perimeter office with a light switch, 80% lighting load is assumed when
occupied and 0% when unoccupied; for conference rooms, 25% when occupied and 0%
when unoccupied.
6.
The conduction values shown constitute calculated values at the Δt for the indicated out-
door temperature. They are applied as internal loads only in specific system tabulations,
for air volume calculations, to the extent that they are not balanced by auxiliary heating
systems (e.g., perimeter radiation or terminal heating coils).

Fan temperature rise = (0.363) (6) / (0.6) (0.9) (0.95)
= 4.25°F, independent of airflow
= [(0.829) (1.49) / (0.6) (0.9) (0.95) = 2.4°C]
Assuming a 1°F [0.6°C] temperature gain from that portion of
the supply duct that passes through 90°F [32°C] unconditioned sur-
roundings, the supply air temperature becomes 50 + 4.25 + 1 =
55.25°F [10.0 + 2.4 + 0.6 = 13.0°C].
Using Equation (1) in Chapter 6, the trial supply air quantity
for sensible cooling is obtained as 3,259,000 / (1.1) (76 – 55.25) =
142,800 cfm [955,213 / (1.2) (24.4 – 12.9) = 67,387 L/s]
Recirculated airflow equals supply airflow minus outdoor airflow.
Recirculated airflow = 142,800 – 32,000 = 110,800 cfm
[67,387 – 15,100 = 52,286 L/s].
Now check the assumed heat gain from the ceiling and floor.
Using the appropriate equation from the “Duct Design” chapter of
the ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals, the difference between
room and return air plenum temperatures is found from:
(lighting heat in plenum) / ((0.5) (floor and ceiling conduction)
+ (1.1) (return airflow)
(1,496,000) / (0.5) ((160,000) (0.77 + 0.43))
+ ((1.1) (110,800)) = 6.87°F
[(438,478) / (0.5) ((14,870) (4.37 + 2.44))
+ ((1.2) (52,286)) = 3.86°C]
where
1,496,000 [438,478] = lighting heat into plenum (from Step 1)
160,000 [14,870] = floor area (from B-2.1)
0.77 [4.37] = floor U-factor (from B-2.1)
0.43 [2.44] = ceiling U-factor (from B-2.1)
110,800 [52,286] = return (recirculated) airflow (see above)
The difference between room temperature and average return
air plenum temperature is one-half of that value, and the heat gain
from the ceiling and floor plenums then becomes:
(160,000) (0.77 + 0.43) (6.87) / 2 = 659,520 Btu/h
[(14,870) (4.37 + 2.44) (3.86) / 2 = 195,441 W]
Step 3. A revised try for airflow, repeating steps 1 and 2 with new
values gives the following:
300⏐ APPENDIX B
Heat gain from ceiling and floor = 659,520 Btu/h [193.3 kW]
Lighting and miscellaneous heat gain
= 803,000 + 273,000 = 1,076,000 Btu/h
= [235.4 + 80.0 = 315.4 kW]
Simultaneous maximum transmission gain
= 1,071,000 Btu/h [313.9 kW]
People load = (2140 occupants) (240) = 513,600 Btu/h
= [(2140) (0.07 kW) = 150.5 kW]
Sensible heat load (revised) = 3,320,120 Btu/h [973.1 kW]
Revised supply airflow
= (3,320,120) / (1.1) (76 – 55.25) = 145,460 cfm
[(973,127) / (1.2) (24.4 – 12.92) = 70, 639 L/s]
Revised recirculated airflow = (145,460 – 32,000) = 113,460 cfm
[70,639 – 15,101 = 55,538 L/s]
Temperature difference
= 1,496,000 / (96,000 + (1.1) (113,460)) = 6.77°F
[438,478 / (50,632 + (1.2) (55,538)) = 3.74°C]
Return air plenum temperature
= (76 + 6.8) = 82.8°F [24.4 + 3.76 = 28.2°C]
Heat gain from ceiling and floor
= (160,000) (0.77 + 0.43) (6.77/2) = 649,920 Btu/h
[(14,870) (4.37 + 2.44) (3.74/2) = 189.4 kW]
Return plenum heat gain
= (1.1) (113,460) (6.77°F) = 844,937 Btu/h
[(1.2) (55,538) (3.74) = 249.3 kW]
Total direct lighting heat emission to plenum
= (649,920 + 844,937) = 1,494,857 Btu/h
[(189.4 + 249.3) = 438.7 kW]
This is within 0.08% of the direct heat emission stated in the
breakdown criteria. Note that this is 44% instead of the 40% light-
ing load fraction assumed. The total heat gain contribution from
direct and indirect heat of light is 1,076,000 + 649,920 =
1,725,920 Btu/h [505,867 kW] or 67% of the total electric load.
Step 4. Find the room sensible heat ratio and check to see that the
design room temperature is obtainable. Use Figure B-1(A). Plot the
room design air state of 76°F [24.4°C] db, 45% RH.

a 5.25°F [2.92°C] rise from the 50°F [10°C] coil temperature, could
not possibly fall anywhere along this process line—see dotted line
in Figure B-l(A). A reasonable coil temperature must be assumed
before the actual room humidity ratio and total system load can be
determined, since the latter is a function of actual, not design,
humidity.
A final adjustment to the calculated loads must always be made
based upon a given room design condition, when the state of air
leaving the actual selected coil is low enough in dew point to
depress the room humidity below the selected design condition. If
reconciliation is not made between the calculated load and the air
load from the psychrometric chart conditions, the calculated load
may be too low. Also, since the final leaving coil air condition can-
not be determined until the total system load is known, a generali-
zation will suffice to zero in on a reasonable coil condition. It is
based upon the average coil surface temperature, which may be
approximated closely as the intersection of the cooling line with the
saturation curve (assumed straight), in this case, line m-cc extended
in Figure B-1(A). The generalization may be expressed as:
(tccs – tEchw) / (wbtcc – tEchw) = Kcc
(B-2)
where
tccs
= coil surface temperature as defined previously
tEchw =
entering chilled-water temperature
wbtcc
= wet-bulb temperature of air leaving coil
Kcc
= chilled-water coil constant
Kcc is a function of the ratio of extended surface to prime sur-
face of a coil. It varies from about 0.5 for circular fin coils with
8 fins per in. [0.32 per mm] spacing to 0.7 for those with 14 fins per
in. [0.55 per mm] and from about 0.6 to 0.75 for continuous plate
fin coils. The overall effect for a given tEchw is to raise the leaving
coil dew-point temperature as the extended surface ratio increases.
302⏐ APPENDIX B
The designer should always check the assumed cooling coil temper-
ature against that obtainable with final coil selection.
Step 5. Find the dry-bulb temperatures and humidities of return air
and mixed air. These humidities can only be found by trial and error
using Equations (B-1) and (B-2). From Equation (B-1), the return
fan temperature rise equals (0.36) (1 in.) / (0.6) (0.9) (0.95) =
0.71°F [(0.829) (0.248) / (0.6) (0.9) (0.95) = 0.40°C]. Assume a
return duct transmission gain (in the unconditioned space) of
0.29°F [0.16°C]. Then the return air temperature becomes 76 + 6.77
+ 0.29 + 0.71 = 83.8°F [24.4 + 3.76 + 0.16 + 0.39 = 28.7°C]
(point r in Figure B-la). Also plot point o, the state of outdoor air.
From Equation (5a) in Chapter 6, and the developed 22% outdoor
air ratio, the mixed-air temperature is found to be 83.8 + 0.22 (95 –
83.8) = 86.26°F [28.7 + 0.22 (35 – 28.7) = 30.09°C].
Assume a coil with Kcc = 0.5. Graphically, start with a lower
room humidity than the design condition and plot in sequence the
temperatures of Equation (B-2) such that Kcc = 0.5. This occurs
when wbtcc = 48.4°F [9.1°C], tccs = 46.4°F [8.0°C], and tEchw =
44.4°F [6.89°C]. Figure B-la shows this at a room condition of 76°F
db/60°F wb [24.4°C/15.6°C] (RH = 38.7%), which is considerably
below the 45% design relative humidity. At this point, coil selection
should be checked with actual manufacturer's data to verify that
conditions are attainable with an optimum selection of coil area,
rows, water flow rate, tEchw, and water temperature rise.
Step 6. Find the final total system cooling load from load compo-
nent summation and psychrometric chart values.

Room latent heat

Step 7. Find the total coil load from the enthalpy difference between
mixed air and coil leaving air.
Coil load
(4.5) (145,460) (30.56 – 19.43) = 7,287,400 Btu/h
[(1.2) (68,643) (71.08 – 45.19) = 2132 kW]
Step 8. Find the total load from temperature and humidity ratio dif-
ferences across the coil.
Sensible coil load (1.1) (145,460) (86.26 – 50.0) = 5,801,818 Btu/h
[(1.2) (68,643) (30.15 – 10.0) = 1660 kW]
Latent coil load
4840 × 145,460 (0.00885 – 0.00683) =
1,422,520 Btu/h
[(3) (68,643) (8.85 – 6.83) = 416 kW]
Total coil load
= 7,224,338 Btu/h [2076 kW]
B.4 COMMENTS
a.
Steps 6, 7, and 8 illustrate good reconciliation between three
calculation methods, including the psychrometric chart analy-
sis, to synthesize the total load.
b.
Note that the entire ceiling plenum load becomes a system load
only when all the air from the room is returned to the supply
fan. In the extreme case (if all the return air were relieved after
the return air fan) the heat from the ceiling plenum that is
added to the return air never becomes a system cooling load.
c.
The full load with a 5.23 W/ft2 [56.3 W/m2] electric load
requires only (145,460 cfm) / (160,000 ft2) = 0.91 cfm/ft2
[(68,643 L/s) / (14,870 m2 = 4.62 L/s m2] because of the heat
of lighting in the return air, even with a moderate supply air
temperature difference of 20.75°F [11.5°C]. If the ceiling were
not used as a return air plenum, this load of 845,230 Btu/h
[248 kW] would become a room sensible load requiring
approximately 37,000 more cfm [17,460 L/s], or a total supply
of 1.14 cfm/ft2 [5.79 L/s m2].

C.1 INTRODUCTION
This analysis is for the same building considered in Appendix
B. Data not shown here are taken from that appendix. The follow-
ing description defines the building systems in more detail. The
focus of this appendix is upon the interrelationship of loads, indoor
air quality concerns, and controls for a VAV HVAC system with
perimeter radiation as applied in this particular building context.
Any conclusions drawn from this analysis of systems apply only to
the specific application presented and do not necessarily apply uni-
versally. Specific values for various design variables on a particu-
lar project would need to comply with local codes and match the
design intent of the owner and design team. Although the values
presented here are specific to this example, the issues discussed are
typical for applications of this type of system.
1.
A continuous perimeter hot-water radiation system is assumed
with scheduling of the supply water temperature from the out-
door air temperature. It is sized throughout for adequate auxil-
iary heat to maintain a 76°F [24.4°C] room temperature by
replacing the heat loss via conduction plus any infiltration.
Scheduling options are illustrated.
2.
Full-closing VAV units are assumed in this example, but means
for maintaining a minimum acceptable air motion and ventila-
tion rate without minimum positioning are illustrated. Note
that, in general, it is not good practice to use full-closing VAV
boxes in occupied spaces.
3.
Multiple-zone flexibility is illustrated by examining interior
and perimeter exposed areas of different uses.
4.
The benefits of full diversity are taken.

Table C-1 (part “a” in I-P units; part “b” in SI units) completes
the basic information from Table B-1 for this particular system.
As noted in Chapter 1, this appendix presents an example from
a real project. This project was selected for the first edition of this
manual and has been retained for the second edition. Some design
values may, as a result, appear dated. This is, however, not too crit-
ical in the context of a process example. The purpose of this appen-
dix is not to show expected results or recommended inputs for any
given project but rather to outline design procedures and consider-
ations. Economic analyses and conclusions are particularly vulner-
able to local conditions and assumptions. The conclusions
presented here regarding economic decisions should not be viewed
as establishing general patterns or directions for design decision
making.
The analyses in this appendix were conducted in I-P units. SI
units have also been provided, but I-P and SI numerical values may
not correspond exactly due to rounding and approximations during
conversions.
C.2 CALCULATIONS AT SUMMER PEAK
The calculations and psychrometric chart for the simple, sin-
gle-zone cooling application with a draw-through fan may be con-
sidered identical to this VAV application for the analysis of average
system conditions at summer design. Figure C-1(A) therefore
shows, using solid lines for system averages, the identical summer
plot as in Figure B-1, while the dotted processes are for special
rooms defined in Table C-1. The room state subscript numerals cor-
respond to the column numbers in the table.
Note 4 in Table C-1 shows the direct lighting heat emission to
each room from ceiling fixtures and miscellaneous room electric
loads plus the indirect heat as a function of the building’s average
ceiling temperature rather than as a percentage of the individual
maximum direct lighting heat emission to the ceiling. The plenum
temperature is therefore a function of the percent of the system’s
entire full-load ceiling lighting, independent of the specific ceiling
lighting intensity for any specific room.
Room 1: Lecture and Projection, Peak Load (see column 1, Table
C-1). Take ceiling lighting alone as 3 W/ft2 [32.2 W/m2], miscella-
neous electrical loads as 1 W/ft2 [10.8 W/m2], and the temperature
difference between plenum air and room air as 3.39°F [1.88°C]
(from Appendix B). Again, as in Appendix B, assume 35% of the

Notes for Table C-1a
(1) Electrical loads in specific areas vary from the average of 5.23 W/ft2, depending upon wall and floor outlet usage or nonstandard ceiling lighting. Loads are intended to represent
actual demands, not connected loads.
(2) Loads are pure wall and glass conduction with no allowance or prorating for roof.
(3) These are solar loads over and above conduction loads. Items (2) and (3) for each area correspond to the maximum loads (Btu/ft2) from Section B-2.3, Summer Design Trans-
mission Loads. Only Room 3, south, is given at its noon peak; all other rooms peak individually but simultaneously in late afternoon.
(4) Direct heat emission from lights to any room is considered to be the same for all systems, but indirect transmissions through floor and ceilings from the return air plenum are a
function of the average ceiling temperature, which varies with the return air volume from the room and the temperature above the deck or below the floor adjacent to unconditioned
spaces.
(5) The percent of full load lighting indicated applies only to the indicated rooms. General building lighting for all analyses using 65/65°F outdoor conditions is 75%. For interior
spaces, 65% of full load lighting is assumed a realistic minimum in a preplanned, modular lighting system for an area without extensive plug loads and task lighting, since local
occupancy switches are rarely provided. For a perimeter office with a light switch, 80% lighting load is assumed when occupied and 0% when unoccupied; for conference rooms,
25% when occupied and 0% when unoccupied.
(6) The conduction values shown constitute calculated values at the Δt for the indicated outdoor temperature. They are applied as internal loads only in specific systems tabulations,
for air volume calculations, to the extent that they are not balanced by auxiliary heating systems (e.g., perimeter radiation or terminal heating coils).

C.3 CALCULATIONS FOR PART-LOAD COOLING
C.3.1 System Analysis for Outdoor Conditions 65/65°F
[18.3°C/18.3°C], No Sun, 75% Electric and 100%
Occupancy Loads
With true VAV, only the following changes on the psychromet-
ric chart have an effect on room conditions (see Figure C-2):
1.
The cooling coil temperature will suffer a natural control droop
from the discharge thermostat that controls it as well as from
the controller of the refrigerated medium. For part-load humid-
ity control, it is desirable to permit this to occur, and some
designs even have a desired droop programmed into their con-
trol cycle. Note, however, that this tends to increase the throt-
tling ratio for VAV-controlled zones.
2.
The temperature rise from supply fan heat and duct gains may
change as the result of a drop in system air volume and differ-
ent ceiling plenum balances and temperatures. Although Equa-
tion B-1 shows the fan heat temperature rise to be independent
of airflow rate, it is an inverse function of fan efficiency at any
given operating condition. This may vary in any given fan, as
the constant static pressure control operates the various devices
and may rise or fall, depending upon the position of the
full-load operating point on the efficiency curve, the type of
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐319
control, and the part-load value. For consistency in compari-
sons within these appendices, it is assumed that variable-inlet
vanes are used and, within the range of 100% to 50% of system
volume, the bhp is taken to be proportional to the percent of
full-load volume. Therefore, the temperature change is 48 +
5.25 = 53.25°F [8.9 + 2.9 = 11.8°C]. This tends to keep the fan
rise constant within the stated range regardless of volume.
Note, however, that the fan efficiency for variable-speed drives

separate perimeter radiation at outdoor conditions of 65°F/65°F
[18.3°C/18.3°C].
320⏐ APPENDIX C
remains constant in the range typical for VAV systems. Vari-
able-speed drives would be the norm for most current projects.
3.
For any given room latent load, the room SHR decreases as the
room supply air volume is decreased to meet reduced room
sensible loads.
4.
At constant room airflow rate, the temperature rise from the
ceiling heat of lighting is proportional to the percent of full
lighting load. This percentage, however, varies inversely with
room air supply volume. Repeat the trial-and-error solution for
this quantity, illustrated in steps 1 through 3 of the cooling load
calculations in Appendix B, for 75% lighting and miscella-
neous electric loads, full occupancy, and a greater ratio of
lighting loads into the room than the 44% found previously.
With a substantially lower room air volume, assume a ratio of
57% because of the inverse relationship.

Supply air of 78,300 cfm [36,950 L/s] is at a temperature of
53.25°F [11.8°C], allowing for a rise to room air temperature of
22.75°F [12.64°C]. This represents 54% of the full-load air supply
and an average of 0.49 cfm/ft2 [2.49 L/s m2]. Assume, however,
that 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2] is the minimum acceptable value
(see Section C-3.2.5) for a total of 104,000 cfm [49,078 L/s]. In
actual operation, when a controller senses a system reduction to this
desired minimum point, the supply air temperature can be sched-
uled to rise to some tolerable point that still permits adequate cool-
ing at this minimum volume. In this case, a Δt of 17.9°F [9.9°C],
i.e., a supply air temperature of 58.1°F [14.5°C], would be neces-
sary with a cooling coil temperature of 52.85°F [11.6°C] as shown
in the upper cycles of Figure C-2. If this coil temperature were too
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐321
high or if the load were lower, the basic outdoor air radiation sched-
ule could be elevated as a second step, after the maximum accept-
able supply air temperature has been reached—all from the same
flow-volume sensing device. It is reasonable to assume that 58.1°F
[14.5°C] is satisfactory until its use is checked for desired perfor-
mance in the special rooms, and the 104,000 cfm [49,078 L/s] may
be used for the first try in the modified ceiling temperature rise
equation, as before:
I-P:
SI:
There is no need to check the heat load from the plenums, since
it was predicated on an arbitrary return air rate of 104,000 – 32,000
= 72,000 cfm (49,078 – 15,101 = 33,977 L/s). However, the
trial-and-error cycle must be closed by checking the amount of heat
from lighting directly emitted to the plenum against the assumed
value of (0.75) (1,496,000 Btu/h) = 1,122,000 Btu/h [(0.75)
(438.5 kW) = 328.9 kW], which checks very closely as shown in
the following calculation (Btu/h [kW]).
Load from plenums to room
(160,000) (1.2) (3.2) = 614,400
[(14,870) (6.8) (1.8) = 180.1]

[(1.2) (33,977) (3.56) = 148.6]

Were it not for the need to raise the supply air temperature
above the design point to control air volume, the system per-
cent-of-full-load-operation would have no effect on the room
relative humidity, since the latter is strictly a function of that
temperature, not the system load. For this particular system
load, and a required supply air temperature of 58.1°F [14.5°C],
simple chilled-water temperature or flow control may be con-
sidered first if most or all room conditions can be satisfied with
the higher dew-point temperature at the cooling coil. Terminal
reheat, ceiling induction, or local fan recirculation with ceiling
plenum mix may be a more economical solution (in both dol-
lars and energy use) than main air system reheat to take care of

C.3.2 Room Analyses for Outdoor Conditions 65/65°F
[18.3°C/18.3°C], No Sun, with Electric and Occupancy
Loads as Noted in Table C-1
The calculations follow the previous pattern. Special condi-
tions are highlighted below.

= (5,000 ft2) (1.2) (3.2) = 19,200
[(465 m2) (6.8) (1.77) = 5.63]
Completing the summation in Table C-1 as before with SHR =
0.60 requires a coil temperature to find the supply air temperature.
With a rise of 5.25°F [2.92°C] (assuming that Δt will stay substan-
tially the same with decreased air volume and a smaller temperature
difference between plenum and supply air), then the coil tempera-
ture is 58.1 – 5.25 = 52.85°F [14.5 – 2.92 = 11.58°C]. With a lower
air velocity across the coil, the leaving air will be more saturated
than at full load; so, in Figure C-2 the upper cycle is plotted at 52.85/
51.6°F [11.58/10.89°C], and the supply air will be at 58.1/53.0°F
[14.5/11.67°C]. For SHR = 0.60, relative humidity (RH2) = 55%.
This result warrants an interesting observation that is seldom
considered by designers when examining part-load and no-load
conditions. Unless a particular room is under a roof (or over an
unconditioned space, or its ceiling cavity is completely isolated
from the remaining ceiling cavities on the floor, or unless all
building lighting is suspended within the room) the room is never
under a true no-load condition, even with no lighting or occu-
pancy. Thus, there is always a notable plenum load when a build-
ing is occupied and, if the perimeter conduction loss is
adequately treated, the floor and ceiling heat gains constitute a
year-round heat gain and these surfaces also act as radiant heat-
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐323
ing panels. Without this effect, this crowded lecture room with-
out operating lighting would have an SHR of 0.535 and a relative
humidity of 59.5% (see Figure C-2, line s-R1). This effect is even
more pronounced in lowering room humidity when recessed light
fixtures are used in a dead ceiling with a higher plenum tempera-
ture.
2.
Room 2 at 65% electric and 100% occupancy loads.
The table is self-explanatory. In order to avoid graphically
overloading Figure C-2, the psychrometric conditions for this room
are not shown in the figure.
3.
Room 3 at 80% electric and 100% occupancy loads.
The conduction load is neutralized by radiation and is there-
fore zero.
4.
Room 4 at 25% lighting and 100% occupancy loads.
Similarly, the conduction load is zero. The room airflow rate is
977 cfm [461 L/s], which equals 0.54 cfm/ft2 [2.74 L/s m2]. Since
this is less than the 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2] criterion (see Section
C-3.2.5), even though it meets cooling requirements and the room
has an infrequent use pattern, an expedient that takes care of such a
space without penalizing the entire system is worth considering. One
of the simplest ways to provide minimum air motion in a conference
room, if temperature and humidity control are not a problem, is to
employ an exhaust fan at the minimum desired unit airflow value
with makeup from neighboring spaces through relief grilles. This
permits the target criteria to be satisfied with minimal additional
cost. From a psychrometric perspective, 977 cfm [461 L/s] mixes
with an extra 198 cfm [93 L/s] of relief air at room conditions when
the room is occupied. This yields the same room relative humidity
with a satisfactory volume of total air movement.
5.
Room 5 at 80% lighting and 100% occupancy loads.
This room needs 188 cfm [89 L/s] or 0.59 cfm/ft2 [3.0 L/s m2].
The intense solar effect at design condition places too much of a throt-
tling demand on a west perimeter zone during sunless periods, with a
similar but less intense situation for the east exposure. During weather
below 76°F [24.4°C], this can be taken care of with separate zoning of
east and west radiation and selective reset of the radiation schedule for
excess radiation, when appropriate, to maintain the minimum airflow
in the shaded rooms. Thus, Room 5 would need only 400 Btu/h
[117 W] excess radiation to maintain 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2]. If
moving shadows result in simultaneous sunlit and shaded rooms on
the same exposure, with the shaded room set for radiation to maintain
324⏐ APPENDIX C
0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2], the sunlit room will have excess cooling
available to neutralize the solar radiation effect in each module (16 ft
deep, 1 ft wide [4.9 by 0.3 m]) in a west exposure of (1.1) (2.34 –
0.65 cfm/ft2) (76 – 58.1) = 33.3 Btu/h ft2 [(1.2) (11.89 – 3.30 L/s m2)
(24.4 – 14.5) = 102 kW/m2], which is more than required to neutralize
the excess radiation and the sun effect in a sunlit room. During
weather above 76°F [24.4°C], the problem is nonexistent because the
additional conduction load brings the sensible load and the room air
rate within the criteria limits.
Since room types 2, 3, and 5 constitute practically the entire
building and can be maintained at 45.5% relative humidity or less
with a supply temperature of 58.1°F [14.5°C], the designer should
explore raising this temperature and even lowering the room tem-
perature somewhat below 76°F [24.4°C] in order to raise the room
airflow rate. In the illustration given, there is no doubt that the west-
and east-side exposures could be brought up to 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30
L/s m2] with supply air scheduling alone, leaving radiation
sequence reset only for more stringent requirements. The tabulation
is shown with excess radiation.
With effective distribution, 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2] can pro-
duce in excess of 10 fpm [0.05 m/s] air motion in the occupied
zone. Simple VAV systems under certain part-load conditions can
operate satisfactorily with considerably less than that value,
although occupant complaints have been encountered. The designer
must use judgment in appraising these results, and the effect of air
quality control and code restrictions during part-load operation,
upon the design. Diffusers with a high induction ratio may be help-
ful in avoiding potential low-circulation problems.
C.4 COOLING CALCULATIONS FOR
WINTER PEAK LOAD
This analysis assumes outdoor conditions of 0°F [–17.8°C] and
relates to Figure C-1(B).
C.4.1 System Load Calculations at Peak Cooling,
100% Lighting, Occupancy, and Solar Loads
When the entire perimeter conduction and infiltration heat loss
is balanced by auxiliary radiation, there is no transmission heat gain
from the wall, only a solar gain.
The entire air system is on a year-round room cooling cycle
except for an interior warm-up period or for interior spaces with
exposed roof or floor. Therefore, no main system coil heat is
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐325
required unless the mixed air temperature at minimum outdoor air
volume is lower than needed to maintain the desired supply air tem-
perature after fan and supply duct heat gains have been added to the
mixed-air temperature.
Since a high-limit humidity control problem is nonexistent
below 58°F [14.4°C] outdoor air temperature, the supply air tem-
perature may be determined on the basis of providing enough cool-
ing for all spaces—while not being so low as to create air
movement or cold draft problems.
For maximum cooling conditions, take full lighting and occu-
pancy loads and an assumed block solar gain of 530 MBh
[155.3 kW]. This load has not been calculated, but can be shown to
be approximately 77% of the 685 MBh [200.8 kW] summer block
peak.

[18.3°C/18.3°C] condition. Hence, for practical purposes (since
the full-load volume was 145,500 cfm [68,662 L/s]), take all ple-
num, lighting, electrical, and occupancy values the same as for full
load, and the above loads for the 95°F [35°C] day can be used for
the 0°F [–17.8°C] day in the Table C-1 summary. Room conditions
may be examined for the extreme conditions of maximum and
minimum cooling in each room without regard to room humidity.
C.4.2 Room Calculations at 0°F [–17.8°C] for
Maximum and Minimum Room Cooling under
Maximum System Cooling Conditions
1.
Rooms 1 and 2, Interior
At maximum cooling, Table C-1 indicates that any interior
space would require the same air quantities and temperatures as for
peak summer conditions. As a practical matter, wide experience
with interior constant-volume cooling systems has shown that the
supply air temperature must be several degrees higher in the winter
326⏐ APPENDIX C
than in the summer to avoid complaints. Therefore, assume that
ordinary interior rooms, such as Room 2, can be satisfied with
58.1°F [14.5°C] supply air and the same air volumes as for the
peak summer condition. Consequently, the cfm/ft2 [L/s m2] values
for such interior offices are left at peak summer values, even
though the higher supply temperature calculates out to 1.17 cfm/ft2
[5.94 L/s m2]. The lecture room is left at the calculated higher
1.17 cfm/ft2 [5.94 L/s m2] peak volume because of the high occu-
pancy density and its effect on indoor air quality.
For minimum cooling, the worst type of situation that could
occur in general office areas would be for local air distribution to be
designed for greater modular flexibility with a peak capability of
handling 6 W/ft2 [64.6 W/m2] of lighting for full load in the Table
C-1 criteria, including a 1 W/ft2 [10.8 W/m2] allowance for miscel-
laneous electrical loads and a 60 ft2 [5.6 m2] per occupant concen-
tration. If a particular tenant had no miscellaneous electrical loads
and only 4 W/ft2 [43.0 W/m2] ceiling lighting with no occupancy,
the only cooling load is the direct lighting load plus a reduced ple-
num load if the situation were to exist over the entire floor without
air volume reduction. The designer is left with many choices, such
as (a) accepting lower minimum air volumes, (b) raising system
volume with higher coil and supply temperatures to preserve cool-
ing capability in perimeter areas, (c) terminal reheat or induction
reheat for low part-load areas, or (d) local recirculation. To carry
through the simple VAV approach, it is assumed here that a combi-
nation of higher supply air temperature (controlled from system
volume) and lower room temperature will be programmed to main-
tain a minimum 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2] of supply air at 61.5°F
[16.4°C]. These results are shown in Table C-1 as the two extremes
with 58.1°F [14.5°C] supply air for maximum cooling and 61.5°F
[16.4°C] for minimum cooling.
The lecture room with an assumed minimum load of no light-
ing, 25% occupancy, and a substantial load from a common ceiling
plenum would have a load of only 15,000 + 20,340 = 35,340 Btu/h
[4.4 + 5.9 = 10.3 kW]. In the worst case, however, such a room
would be isolated for fire rating purposes and remain with no heat
load except the 15,000 Btu/h [4.4 kW] from occupancy, shown for
minimum cooling in Room 1. A local fan unit, which mixes VAV
system supply air and recirculated air to produce a constant
1.01 cfm/ft2 [5.13 L/s m2], can handle all situations (in lieu of over-
airing). The processes for such a unit are shown as a dotted line in
the upper cycle of Figure C-2. With occupancy as the only load,
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐327
process line s-R1' is at an SHR of 240/450 = 0.53. The supply air
state sl” at 64.3°F [17.9°C] is the mixture required for full occu-
pancy, and sl' at 73.1°F [22.8°C] for 25% occupancy, both yielding
room air of 76°F db [24.4°C], 59% RH. If this type of room suf-
fered any heat losses (i.e., exposure), then reheat should be consid-
ered to keep relative humidity below 60%.
2.
Room 3
At minimum cooling with 61.5°F [16.4°C] supply air, a mini-
mum volume of 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2] requires a sensible load
of 4150 Btu/h [1.2 kW] to maintain a room temperature of 76°F
[24.4°C], or 3300 Btu/h [0.97 kW] to maintain 73°F [22.8°C]. The
former will occur with 80% lighting and one occupant, while the
latter will occur with about 70% lighting and one occupant, both
without any excess radiation or reheat. When a building facade has
moving shadows, it is usually impractical to provide individual
room control of radiation output or facade zoning to avoid excess
radiation in the sunlit areas. It is easier to design on the basis of all
areas receiving enough radiation to neutralize the minimum VAV at
some supply temperature, such as the 61.5°F [16.4°C] of this exam-
ple, when any area is sunlit without an internal load. Thus, the
shaded areas will receive enough excess radiation to keep all
south-facing VAV controls at the minimum air volume, while rooms
in the sun require some additional air to neutralize the radiation and
maintain control on a year-round cooling cycle. Therefore,
4150 Btu/h [1.2 kW] is used in Table C-1 and is assumed to have
come from some combination of lighting and excess radiation. For
example, a shaded south-facing room could conceivably be unoccu-
pied, unlit, and without solar gain, while the remainder of the build-
ing is generally occupied. Assuming individual room VAV control,
such a room would have to be heated by radiation only enough to
handle the conduction loss plus the minimum air volume of
0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2] tempered from 61.5°F to 76°F [16.4°C to
24.4°C]. To design for this worst condition requires 4150 Btu/h
[1.2 kW] of excess radiation, which becomes a cooling burden in a
sunlit, fully loaded identical room on the same radiation riser with-
out individualized room radiation control. This is the reason for the
4150 Btu/h [1.2 kW] of radiation load (excess) for Room 3 and
4100 Btu/h [1.2 kW] for Room 5.
At maximum noon cooling, the winter design condition in the
south governs the peak room airflow but, with true VAV, only the
south-facing branches and diffusers need be sized to handle the
peak—not the system fan, since air that is not required in other
328⏐ APPENDIX C
areas is probably available. With supply air at 58.1°F [14.5°C] and
the 4150 Btu/h [1.2 kW] excess radiation for the worst-case sce-
nario, this room needs 2.15 cfm/ft2 [10.9 L/s m2] to maintain 76°F
[24.4°C] instead of the summer peak of 1.85 cfm/ft2 [9.4 L/s m2],
an increase of 0.3 cfm/ft2 [1.5 L/s m2]. If all south-facing offices
were the same, an additional volume of (17,675 ft2 of south-facing
perimeter) (0.30 cfm/ft2) = 5,302 cfm [(1643 m2) (1.5 L/s m2) =
2465 L/s] would be required at the period of south peak. Other cal-
culations for full-load cooling on a 0°F [–17.8°C] day (not shown)
indicate a diversity reserve of (145,000 – 121,400) = 24,100 cfm
[(68,426 – 57,289 = 11,137 L/s] several hours later, which trans-
lates into a much greater reserve during the south peak, especially
when occupancy and lighting diversity is allowed for the entire
southern facade, because most of the offices have a lighting load of
4.5 W/ft2 [48.8 W/m2] rather than 5.75 W/ft2 [61.9 W/m2].
3.
Room 4, North Conference Room
The north, winter, maximum cooling load without conduction
gain, being considerably lower than the summer load, is still
enough to permit 0.76 cfm/ft2 [3.86 L/s m2]. No excess radiation is
required, since all north-facing rooms would receive only enough
radiation to balance the conduction losses.
The minimum cooling load with 25% lighting and no solar and
no occupancy needs only 0.37 cfm/ft2 [1.88 L/s m2] from the VAV
system at 61.5°F [16.4°C] supply air, but air movement can be kept
to the minimum 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2] with the exhaust fan and
relief from an adjacent area.
4.
Room 5
The cooling load can vary from zero to 13,685 Btu/h [4.0 kW]
with full solar, occupancy, and lighting. A maximum 0°F [–17.8°C]
day cooling load requires 2.87 cfm/ft2 [14.6 L/s m2] of 55.25°F
[12.92°C] air, while a no-load room requires 4100 Btu/h [1.2 kW]
excess radiation to provide the minimum 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2]
with 61.5°F [16.4°C] air. This excess radiation may be treated as
described for Room 3.
5.
Condition at Zero Lighting
Although there might be an occasional occupied perimeter
space without lighting or plenum gains, a practical solution is
excess radiation for typical rooms, such as 3 and 5, and exhausters
for special rooms. It is assumed that general office interior areas are
not occupied unless the lighting is on, and, if the entire interior
were unlit and unoccupied, a full-throttling VAV terminal could go
to complete shutoff. Occasional interior spaces without operating
lighting would have a plenum gain of 3.4 Btu/h ft2 [10.7 W/m2] if
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐329
surrounded by spaces with an average of only 65% full-load light-
ing. This would result in a reduced room temperature of 66.3°F
[19.1°C] with 0.65 cfm/ft2 [3.30 L/s m2] of 61.5°F [16.4°C] supply
air. This is more tolerable, however, than the lower temperatures
encountered with a constant-air-volume system and less
energy-consuming than adding reheat to the system.

D.1 PROJECT CONTEXT
The project featured in this appendix is a new high-rise apart-
ment building located in a large city on the east coast of the United
States. The developer already owned several other apartment build-
ings in the area. This project was targeted primarily toward child-
less business couples in the middle income bracket. The majority of
the apartments were to have one or two bedrooms. The engineer
presented several system alternatives in the concept development
phase of design. Although not the designer’s first choice, the devel-
oper opted for a basic two-pipe fan-coil system. The developer
already owned and operated other buildings with such systems and
was aware of and comfortable with the system's foibles. Tenants in
those buildings complained about stuffiness and lack of cooling
during the spring and fall—but not enough to affect the occupancy
rates. The leases stipulated that cooling would be provided from
May 15 to September 15. Secure in his knowledge of system per-
formance and costs, the client did not want to spend more money
for a four-pipe system or one with water-source heat pumps. The
engineering project manager reluctantly accepted the decision but
convinced the owner to bid an alternative design that would provide
positive ventilation. If the cost of this alternative was close to the
base bid, the owner would accept it.
The designer was concerned that there would be inadequate
cooling during spring and fall in the living areas with a southern
exposure. Assuming 60 cfm [28 L/s] of infiltration through the win-
dows for the heat balance equation (heat gain equals heat loss), the
changeover point for a south-facing living room was checked:

Solving for the changeover temperature tco:
tco = tr – (hourly heat gain, solar + lights + people)
/ ((l.l) (infiltration cfm) + UA)
[tco = tr – (hourly heat gain, solar + lights + people)
/ ((l.2) (infiltration L/s) + UA)]
The following values were estimated for September 15 at
1 p.m.:
tco = 35°F
tco = 1.0°C
The record low for September 15 at the building location was
43°F [6.1°C], which occurred early in the morning. Thus, if cooling
were discontinued any time near this date, discomfort from high
temperatures in the living quarters would be a near certainty. At this
point, the engineer explained his concerns to the owner, suggesting
they provide separate zoning for southern exposures to allow cool-
ing at outdoor temperatures below those normal for September, plus
the addition of supplementary heat to permit control when the solar
load was not present but the zone was still indexed to the cooling
mode. The owner rejected the recommendation because of the com-
plexity and additional expense. The engineer recorded in writing
his concerns, his recommendation, and the owner’s decision.
Fortunately, this process did not end badly because the engi-
neer proposed an alternative bid. The engineer designed a ventila-
tion system for the apartments that was combined with the corridor
air-conditioning system, which was part of the base design. The
system included heat recovery provisions from the central toilet
exhaust to temper the ventilation supply in a rooftop air-condition-
ing unit. Since alternative unit selections were not burdened with
the ventilation cooling load, some money was saved by selecting
smaller fan-coil units and reducing pipe sizes and pump capacity. A
credit was thereby obtained against the increased ventilation system

cost. The additional cost for the alternative design submitted by the
low bidder was $23,000, which was accepted by the owner. The
engineer also received a fee for the additional design effort.
Epilogue: Three years later, the developer undertook another,
larger apartment project with a new architect—but requested the
engineer who designed the previous project. This time, apartment
ventilation was included in the base design. Supplemental electric
heat was considered as an alternative.
D.2 DESIGN EXAMPLE
Any conclusions drawn from this system analysis apply only to
the specific application presented and do not necessarily apply uni-
versally. Specific values for various design variables on a particu-
lar project would need to comply with local codes and match the
design intent of the owner and design team.

D.2.2 Unit Selection
Units selected are for a two-pipe, dual-temperature system
using floor-mounted, under-window fan-coil units with three-speed
fans. Units can be selected for similar pressure losses (as described
below) so that the water distribution system will be self-balancing
or automatic flow-regulating valves can be used. A safety factor of
10% is desired in the capacity of the units.
Comments on Unit Selection (refer to Tables D-1 and D-2)
1.
If the sensible heat ratio (SHR) of the room is lower than the
SHR of the coil, the space humidity may be slightly higher
than the design value. The SHR of both room and coil will
adjust until a balance is struck. The room latent load may
decrease slightly as humidity rises, and the coil will con-
dense more moisture as the dew point of the entering air
increases. Under most circumstances, this is not a design
concern.

342⏐ APPENDIX D
2.
Few unit manufacturers design their coils for consistency of
pressure drop and inherent self-balancing. By adjusting the
flow values obtained from catalog ratings, a fairly tight range
of unit coil pressure drops can be achieved. While ratings are
presented in catalogs according to water temperature rise, there
is no need to select units for those rises and the flows indicated.
In actuality, the rise through any coil will be determined by the
load imposed on it. The return water temperature for the sys-
tem will be based upon the total sum of unit flows and the
block system cooling load. If only a few flow values are
assigned to all the units on a project, the design procedure for
the water distribution system is greatly simplified.
3.
A ducted ventilation supply offers superior performance over
infiltration or open-window ventilation. It also adds to the
project cost. Yet, as the alternative selections indicate, there is
some offsetting cost benefit resulting from smaller unit sizes
and, due to the lower flow requirement, smaller piping and
reduced pumping. If the ventilation air is adequately dehumidi-
fied, very little latent cooling is required of the fan-coil units. If
the water supply to the units can be designed for a temperature
of 50°F [10°C] or higher, little condensation should occur on
the coils. This is desirable to reduce dependence on the drain
pans and condensate removal piping, which are vulnerable to
clogging. Moreover, a wet coil is going to collect more dirt,
which then becomes a moist medium for biological growth,
odor collection, and subsequent introduction into the airstream.
4.
Note that the factor of safety for the west-facing living room,
following unit flow adjustment, is less than the desired 10%.
There are several design options: increase the unit size, accept
a lower factor of safety, increase water flow for all units, or
lower the entering water temperature. The answer will reside
with the designer’s judgment, weighing the specific project
conditions and cost implications.
5.
The chilled-water supply temperature is tentatively selected at
45°F [7.2°C], based upon past experience. A higher tempera-
ture generally results in somewhat larger units and higher space
relative humidity; however, the refrigeration plant could be
smaller and have a higher COP. The opposite results occur with
lower temperatures; therefore, a balance is sought. The pro-
posed 45°F [7.2°C] temperature is also well suited to selecting
cooling coils and air-handling units that serve other areas of the
building.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐343
As the fan-coil units are being selected, a slight adjustment of
the supply chilled-water temperature may produce less expen-
sive equipment options.
6.
Heating capacities of coils selected for cooling are usually
more than adequate because of the higher temperature differ-
ence between the heating water and room conditions. It may be
reasonable to evaluate the heating capacity at reduced flow and
to consider operation with reduced pumping capacity during
the heating mode. Fine-tuning the heating water supply tem-
perature usually results in very limited initial cost reduction for
the effort. In this example, 110°F [43.3°C] has been chosen for
the heating water supply temperature and is (somewhat arbi-
trarily) based upon past practice.

E.1 CONTEXT
This comparison involves both energy analysis values and
energy cost values for a real building project. Specifics of energy
use will vary from project to project but will tend to follow the gen-
eral patterns suggested herein. Economic analyses, however, are
often very dependent upon the cost of energy and particularly the
relative costs of competing or alternative energy sources. This cost-
dependency must be kept in mind when reviewing this comparison.
The example presented in this appendix is a four-story,
264,200 ft2 [24,555 m2] office building designed to operate as a
low-energy-use building with an annual energy budget of
77,500 Btu/ft2 (22.7 kWh/ft2) [244 kWh/m2]. Energy costs were
estimated to be $237,000 per year or $0.90/ft2 [$9.68/m2] per
year—based upon favorable hydroelectric utility rate schedules and
expressed in Canadian dollars.
This appendix presents an example of a real project. This
project was selected for the first edition of this manual and has been
retained for the second edition. Some design values may, as a
result, appear dated. This is, however, not too critical in the context
of a process example. The specific characteristics of any particular
project will vary from those suggested herein—as influenced by cli-
ent requirements, project budget, applicable codes and standards,
and design team intent. The purpose of this appendix is not to show
expected results or recommended inputs for all possible projects
but, rather, to outline design procedures and considerations.
APPENDIX E
PRELIMINARY COMPARISON OF
CONVENTIONAL AND ICE STORAGE
SYSTEMS FOR A FOUR-STORY
OFFICE BUILDING
346⏐ APPENDIX E
A number of design strategies can reduce energy costs below
the budget of $237,000 per year. Such strategies include:
•
Circuiting of perimeter zone electric lighting for daylighting
and peak cooling load control.
•
Computerized switching or low-voltage switching of lighting
circuits.
•
Discriminator control for supply air temperature.
•
Building automation system (BAS) with direct digital control
(DDC).
•
Energy-efficient motors.
•
Variable-speed pumping.
Thermal storage is another possible option. The analysis pre-
sented here compares a conventional variable-air-volume (VAV)
system with water chiller against a low-temperature-air VAV system
with ice storage. The ice storage system will save $2200 per year
based upon the stated utility rates. The ice storage system’s capital
cost is estimated to be equal to or less than that of the conventional
system, according to the mechanical design team for the building.
E.2 BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS
The office building incorporates east and west office wings
linked by a circular rotunda. The total conditioned floor area is
264,200 ft2 [24,555 m2]. The conditioned floor areas are summa-
rized as follows:
Concourse level
67,100 ft2 [6237 m2]
Ground level
53,500 ft2 [4972 m2]
Second level
50,400 ft2 [4684 m2]
Third level

Fourth level
45,000 ft2 [4182 m2]
Total floor area
264,200 ft2 [24,555 m2]
The building was divided into discrete thermal zones for a
computer-based simulation of energy use. Five zones (with areas
expressed in ft2 [m2]) were used in the energy simulation:
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐347
The interior zone requires only cooling and ventilation since
this zone has no significant envelope losses or gains; the other four
zones require both heating and cooling.
Thermal characteristics of the walls, roof, and windows are
summarized as follows:

E.4 END-USE ANALYSIS
Figure E-1 and Table E-1 break down the total annual energy
costs into major energy end-uses: space cooling, space heating,
water heating, operation of fans and pumps, lighting, and other
equipment (e.g., appliances, computers, and process equipment).
The cooling costs are calculated for a conventional cooling system.
This information is useful for pinpointing opportunities for savings.
Detailed summaries of the energy simulation program inputs and
outputs are shown in Tables E-2 and E-3. Note that they include all
energy uses, not just HVAC&R.
Thermal energy storage (TES) cooling systems use electric
chillers to cool water or salt solutions or to make ice during times
of the day when electric rates are lower (off-peak). The stored
cooling is then used for air conditioning when the demand (and

the price) for electricity is higher (on-peak). Figures E-2 and E-3
provide a comparison of electricity use for a conventional cool-
ing system versus a TES (ice storage) system. Note that the TES
system shifts much of the electricity used for air conditioning
from on-peak to off-peak periods.
E.5 MONTHLY OFF-PEAK COOLING ANALYSIS
The on-peak period was assumed to be 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., Mon-
day through Friday. All other times were assumed to be off-peak.

This appendix describes representative sequences of control
operations for a variety of HVAC systems. The symbols used in the
figures and the underlying control philosophies for these systems
are given in Chapter 10.
The purpose of this appendix is to suggest the logic inherent in
control sequences—not to define sequences for all possible systems
and equipment. Generic control symbols are used in the illustrating
figures, and the general descriptions are applicable to all-electric/
electronic controls (including DDC) as well as pneumatic controls.
F.1 VAV SYSTEM, FAN SPEED CONTROL,
RADIATION HEATING, NO RETURN FAN—
SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS
Refer to Figures F-1 and F-2.
A.
Start-up
1.
The supply fan may be started and stopped in one of two
ways:
Manually. The HAND, OFF, AUTO (H-O-A) switch on the
fan motor starter can be set in the HAND (or ON) position to
start the fan and in the OFF position to stop the fan.
Automatically. With the fan motor starter switch in the
AUTO position, the VAV system has three modes of opera-
tion—OFF, NORMAL, and WARM-UP.
2.
Normal operation is initiated (usually at the beginning of
the working day) by a contact closure from local time
clock switch TC1. (In many applications, a central build-
ing automation system [BAS] may be used.) This contact

AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐371
closure provides power to the fan motor starter. Power to
the hot-water temperature control panel, VAV temperature
control panel, and static pressure control panel is supplied
through relay contacts R2-l, R2-2, and R2-3.
3.
At the end of the occupied period, the time clock switch
TC1 (or a BAS) deenergizes the fan starter relay, conse-
quently interrupting power to all the control panels.
4.
To guard against freezing in the building, two-position low-
limit electric freeze protection thermostats (T7) are located
as shown in the drawings. If the temperature drops below
the setpoint of any of the freeze protection thermostats, relay
R1 is energized. Through auxiliary contact R1-1, power is
supplied to the hot-water temperature control panel and,
through a control signal (not shown), the zone thermostats
are made operable to control at the warm-up temperature set-
point. Auxiliary contact R1-2 (normally closed) opens, and
the VAV temperature control panel remains deenergized.
Through auxiliary contact R1-3, the fan motor starter is
energized, and power is supplied to the static pressure con-
trol panel (through auxiliary contact R2-3). With no power to
the VAV temperature control panel, the outdoor air dampers
and the cooling coil valve remain closed. Heat is delivered
through a baseboard heating element in the zone controlled
by the zone thermostat. With the fan on, heat is distributed
throughout the building. On a rise in room temperature, the
contacts on the freeze protection thermostats open, returning
the system to the OFF state.
5.
To provide a preoccupancy warm-up cycle, auxiliary con-
tacts on time clock switch TC2 (or contacts remotely con-
trolled by a BAS) are energized for a period before
occupancy. Closure of these contacts has the same effect as
the closure of contacts on one of the freeze protection ther-
mostats. At the end of the warm-up period, the system
begins normal operation.
B.
Static Pressure Control
1.
The static pressure at a representative point in the ductwork
is held constant by the static pressure control panel.
2.
A tube connects a static pressure tap in the ductwork to
static pressure sensor DP1 located in the static pressure
control panel. The output of the pressure sensor is com-
pared to the static pressure setpoint in PI controller C3.
The output of controller C3 is connected to fan motor
372⏐ APPENDIX F
speed controller MSC on the supply fan. Duct static pres-
sure sensor DP2, via its PI controller C3, and PI controller
C4 operate through a comparator controller so as to modu-
late motor speed controller MSC to a safe high static pres-
sure limit in the ductwork.
3.
The panel is equipped with a soft start circuit. When
power is supplied to the static pressure control panel
through relay contact R2-3, a delay of about 15 seconds
occurs while the output of controller C3 is ramped to zero.
During this delay, the output of controller C3 is discon-
nected from controller MSC. After the delay, the output
from controller C3 is reconnected to controller MSC,
allowing the supply fan to run. The setpoint is gradually
ramped from zero up to the desired setpoint (as determined
by the setpoint adjustment knob), after which the soft start
circuit no longer affects the control system.
4.
The panel is equipped with manual control features,
which, by turning the timer and pressing the SET button,
allow the output of the panel to be adjusted by turning the
manual adjust knob. When the panel is switched to the
manual mode, the soft start circuit first disconnects the
input to controller MSC. After a delay of about 15 sec-
onds, the input to controller MSC is reconnected, and the
voltage output to controller MSC is ramped from zero to
the desired voltage as determined by the position of the
manual adjust knob. Once the manual adjustment voltage
is reached, any manual output changes (i.e., manually
changing the output from 0% to 100%) will pass through a
voltage buffer to prevent sudden changes from causing
excessive duct pressures and keep the fan motor drive from
tripping its circuit breakers. The system is returned to
automatic control when the timer runs down or when the
reset button is pushed. When this occurs, the soft start cir-
cuit functions as if the fan were just being started. The
timer or reset button shall only enable the soft start circuit
when the system is being switched from manual to auto-
matic control. This shall prevent the timer from cycling the
system after it has been placed in the automatic mode via
the reset button.

Supply and Mixed-Air Temperature Control
1.
The supply air temperature is controlled by PI controller
C1, located in the VAV temperature control panel.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐373
2.
The cooling coil chilled-water valve V1 is modulated by
controller C1 using the sensed supply air temperature from
temperature sensor T1. The chilled-water control valve V1
is interlocked to the supply fan through relay R to return to
its normally closed (NC) position with the fan off.
3.
The mixed-air temperature is controlled by PI controller
C2, located in the VAV temperature control panel.
4.
The outdoor, relief, and return air dampers are modulated
by controller C2 using the sensed mixed-air temperature
from temperature sensor T2. The output from controller C2
is connected to the comparator controller, which will pass
the controller signal only if the outdoor air enthalpy (or
temperature) is less than the return air enthalpy (or temper-
ature) as sensed through enthalpy sensors ESOA and
ESRA (or similar temperature sensors). The comparator
controller compares this signal with the signal from the
minimum positioning adjustment knob SW1. If the output
for this comparison is less than the output from SW1, the
minimum positioning signal will operate the return, out-
door, and relief air dampers at their minimum position
unless in the economizer mode. When the use of greater
than minimum outdoor air is economical (in economizer
mode), the signal from controller C2 will be higher than
the signal from SW1 and will operate the outdoor, relief,
and return air dampers accordingly.
5.
Hysteresis is required in the comparator relay controller. A
differential is required between the outdoor air enthalpy (or
temperature) and the return air enthalpy (or temperature) to
prevent cycling.
6.
When the system is off (no power to the control panels) or
if the supply fan is off (through relay R), the return, out-
door, and relief air dampers return to their normally closed
position.
D.
Zone Air Temperature Control
1.
Zone air temperature control is achieved by zone tempera-
ture sensors sending a signal to an application-specific
controller (ASC) to modulate individual VAV boxes.
When heating is required, the room temperature sensor
also modulates the baseboard heater valve.
2.
Thermostat calibration and selection of actuator ranges
shall be coordinated to provide the control action shown in
Figures 10-7 and 10-8 (Chapter 10).

Hot Water Temperature Control
The temperature of hot water supplied to the baseboard heaters
is controlled by the hot water temperature control panel.
F.
Interlocks
Smoke detectors (SD1 and SD2), the low-temperature safety
switch (FZ), and the high-static-pressure limit switch (HPLS)
are wired in series with the fan motor starter and relay R2 to
stop the fan in the event of smoke, extremely low temperatures,
or damagingly high pressures. The ladder schematic on the
drawings shows how equipment is to be interlocked.

Refer to Figures F-1 and F-2.
The sequence of operations is identical to that described in Sec-
tion F.1, with the following exceptions:
1.
The last three sentences under part A.4 are replaced with the
following: “Heat is provided through a reheat coil in the zone
duct controlled by the room thermostat. On a rise in room tem-
perature, the contacts on the freeze protection thermostats open,
returning the system to the off state.”

F.3 VAV SYSTEM, FAN SPEED CONTROL, RADIATION
HEATING, RETURN FAN—SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS
Refer to Figures F-3 and F-4.
A.
Start-up
1.
The supply fan and return fan may be started and stopped
in one of two ways:
Manually. The HAND, OFF, AUTO (H-O-A) switch on the
fan motor starter can be set in the HAND (or ON) position to
start the fan and in the OFF position to stop the fan.
Automatically. With the fan motor starter switch in the
AUTO position, the VAV system has three modes of opera-
tion—OFF, NORMAL, and WARM-UP.
2.
Normal operation is initiated (usually at the beginning of
the working day) by a contact closure from local time
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐375

Figure F-4. Control circuit for system shown in Figure F-3.
376⏐ APPENDIX F
clock switch TC1 (or, commonly, a central building auto-
mation system [BAS]). This contact closure provides
power to the fan motor starters, M1 and M2, and relay R2.
Power to the hot-water temperature control panel, the VAV
temperature control panel, and the static pressure control
panel is supplied through relay contacts R2-1, R2-2, and
R2-3.
3.
At the end of the occupied period, time clock switch TC1
(or a BAS) deenergizes the fan starter relays, consequently
interrupting power to all the control panels.
4.
To guard against freezing in the building, two-position
low-limit electric freeze protection thermostats (T7) are
located as shown in Figures F-3 and F-4. If the tempera-
ture drops below the setpoint of any of the freeze protec-
tion thermostats, relay R1 is energized. Through auxiliary
contact Rl-l, power is supplied to the hot water tempera-
ture control panel and, through a control signal, the zone
thermostats are made operable to control at the warm-up
temperature setpoint. Auxiliary contact R1-2 (normally
closed) opens, and the VAV temperature control panel
remains deenergized. Through auxiliary contacts R1-3 and
R1-4, the fan motor starters are energized, and power is
supplied to the static pressure control panel (through auxil-
iary contact R2-3). With no power to the VAV temperature
control panel, the outdoor air dampers and the cooling coil
valve remain closed. Heat is delivered through a baseboard
heating element in the zone controlled by the zone thermo-
stat. With the fan on, heat is distributed throughout the
building. On a rise in room temperature, the contacts on
the freeze protection thermostats open, returning the sys-
tem to the off state.
5.
To provide a preoccupancy warm-up cycle, auxiliary con-
tacts on time clock switch TC2 (or contacts remotely con-
trolled by a BAS) are energized for a period before
occupancy. Closure of these contacts has exactly the same
effect as the closure of contacts on one of the freeze protec-
tion thermostats. At the end of the warm-up period, the
system begins normal operation.
B.
Static Pressure Control
1.
The static pressure at a representative point in the ductwork
is held constant by the static pressure control panel.
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM DESIGN MANUAL⏐377
2.
A tube connects a static pressure tap in the ductwork to
static pressure sensor DP1 located in the static pressure
control panel. The output of the pressure sensor is com-
pared to the static pressure setpoint in PI controller C3. The
output of controller C3 is connected to fan motor speed
controller MSC on the supply fan and the motor speed con-
troller MSC on the return fan. Duct static pressure sensor
DP2, via its PI controller C4, and PI controller C3 operate
through a comparator controller so as to modulate motor
speed controller MSC to a safe high static pressure limit in
the ductwork. The return fan operates in a similar fashion
from duct static pressure sensor DP3 through PI controllers
C5 and C3 and a comparative controller.
3.
The panel is equipped with a soft start circuit. When
power is supplied to the static pressure control panel
through relay contact R2-3, a delay of about 15 seconds
occurs while the output of controller C3 is ramped to zero.
During this delay, the output of controller C3 is discon-
nected from each controller MSC. After the delay, the out-
put from controller C3 is reconnected to each controller
MSC, allowing the supply fan and return fan to run. The
setpoint is gradually ramped from zero up to the desired
setpoint (as determined by the setpoint adjustment knob),
after which the soft start circuit no longer affects the con-
trol system.
4.
The panel is equipped with manual control features,
which, by turning the timer and pressing the SET button,
allow the output of the panel to be adjusted by turning the
manual adjust knob. When the panel is switched to the
manual mode, the soft start circuit first disconnects the
input to each controller MSC. After a delay of about 15
seconds, the input to each controller MSC is reconnected,
and the voltage output to each controller MSC is ramped
from zero to the desired voltage as determined by the posi-
tion of the manual adjust knob. Once the manual adjust-
ment voltage is reached, any manual output changes (i.e.,
manually changing the output from 0% to 100%) will pass
through a voltage buffer to prevent sudden changes from
causing excessive duct pressures and keep the fan motor
drives from tripping the circuit breakers. The system is
returned to automatic control when the timer runs down or
378⏐ APPENDIX F
when the reset button is pushed. When this occurs, the soft
start circuit functions exactly as if the fans were just being
started. The timer or reset button shall only enable the soft
start circuit when the system is being switched from man-
ual to automatic control. This shall prevent the timer from
cycling the system after it has been placed in the automatic
mode via the reset button.

The supply air temperature is controlled by PI controller
C1, located in the VAV temperature control panel.

is connected to the comparator controller, which will pass
the controller signal only if the outdoor air enthalpy (or

ature) as sensed through enthalpy sensors ESOA and
ESRA (or similar temperature sensors). The comparator
controller compares this signal with the signal from the
minimum positioning adjustment knob SW1. If the output
for this comparison is less than the output from SW1, the
minimum positioning signal will operate the return, out-
door, and relief air dampers at their minimum position
unless in the economizer mode. When using greater than
minimum outdoor air is economical (in economizer mode),
the signal from controller C2 will be higher than the signal
from SW1 and will operate the outdoor, relief, and return
air dampers accordingly.

Hysteresis is required in the comparator relay controller. A
differential is required between the outdoor air enthalpy (or
temperature) and the return air enthalpy (or temperature) to
prevent cycling.
6.
When the system is off (no power to the control panels) or
if the supply fan is off (through relay R), the return, out-
door, and relief air dampers return to their normally closed
position.

Start-up
1.
The supply fan and return fan may be started and stopped
in one of two ways:
Manually. The HAND, OFF, AUTO (H-O-A) switch on the
fan motor starter can be set in the HAND (or ON) position to
start the fan and in the OFF position to stop the fan.
Automatically. With the fan motor starter switch in the
AUTO position, the single-zone HVAC system has three
modes of operation—OFF, NORMAL, and WARM-UP.
2.
Normal operation is initiated (usually at the beginning of
the working day) by a contact closure from local time
clock switch TC1 (or, often, a central building automation
system [BAS]). This contact closure provides power to the
fan motor starter. Power to the single-zone temperature
control panel and the hot water temperature control panel
is supplied through auxiliary contacts M1-1 and M1-2 on
the supply fan motor starter.

At the end of the occupied period, time clock switch TC1
(or a BAS) deenergizes the fan starter relay, consequently
interrupting power to all the control panels.
4.
To guard against freezing in the building, two-position
low-limit electric freeze protection thermostats (T6) are
located as shown in the drawings. If the temperature drops
below the setpoint of any of the freeze protection thermo-
stats, relay R1 is energized. Through auxiliary contact Rl-l,
power is supplied to the fan motor starter, and the single-
zone temperature control panel and the hot water tempera-
ture control panel are energized (through auxiliary contacts
M1-1 and M1-2). Auxiliary contact R1-2 (normally closed)
opens and through a relay (RLT) returns the damper actua-
tors to their normal states, preventing outdoor air from
entering the system. Heat is provided through heating coil
valve V1, which is regulated by controller T1. On a rise in
room temperature, the contacts on the freeze protection
thermostats open, returning the system to the off state.
5.
To provide a preoccupancy warm-up cycle, auxiliary con-
tacts on time clock switch TC2 (or contacts remotely con-
trolled by a BAS) are energized for a period before
occupancy. Closure of these contacts has exactly the same
effect as the closure of contacts on two position low-limit
freeze protection thermostat T3. At the end of the warm-up
period, the system begins normal operation.

The mixed-air temperature, through temperature sensor T2,
is controlled by PI controller C1, located in the single-zone

388⏐ APPENDIX F
2.
Normal operation is initiated (usually at the beginning of
the working day) by a contact closure from local time
clock switch TC1 (or, commonly, a central building auto-
mation system [BAS]). This contact closure provides
power to the fan motor starter. Power to the multizone tem-
perature control panel and the hot water temperature con-

To guard against freezing in the building, two-position low-
limit electric freeze protection thermostats (T6) are located

ers and the cooling coil valve remain closed. The heating
coil valve remains in its normally open state, and the fan
delivers warm air to the zones. On a rise in room tempera-
ture, the contacts on the freeze protection thermostats open,
returning the system to the off state.
5.
To provide a preoccupancy warm-up cycle, auxiliary con-
tacts on time clock switch TC2 (or contacts remotely ener-
gized by a BAS) are energized for a period before
occupancy. Closure of these contacts has exactly the same
effect as the closure of contacts on one of the freeze pro-
tection thermostats. At the end of the warm-up period, the
system begins normal operation.

The outdoor, relief, and return air dampers are modulated

The heating coil hot water valve V2 is modulated by PI
controller C2 using the sensed hot deck air temperature

C2 operates through fan interlock relay R to modulate
valve V2, maintaining a constant hot deck air temperature.
The setpoint of controller C2 is determined by the output
of proportional controller C4 using the sensed outdoor air
temperature from temperature sensor T4—the heating coil
controller is reset on the basis of outdoor air temperature.

The cooling coil chilled-water valve V1 is modulated by
